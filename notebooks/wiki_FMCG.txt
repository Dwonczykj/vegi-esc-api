Examples include non-durable household goods such as packaged foods, beverages, toiletries, candies, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, dry goods, and other consumables.[1][2][3]Fast moving consumer goods have a high inventory turnover and are contrasted with specialty items which have lower sales and higher carrying charges. Many retailers carry only FMCGs; particularly hypermarkets, big box stores and warehouse club stores. Small convenience stores also stock fast moving goods; the limited shelf space is filled with higher turnover items.Characteristics[edit]The following are the main characteristics of FMCGs:[1]From the consumer perspectiveFrequent purchasesLow engagement (little or no effort to choose the item)Low pricesShort shelf lifeRapid consumptionFrom the marketer perspectiveHigh volumesLow contribution marginsExtensive distributionHigh inventory turnoverConsumer Packaged Goods Companies[edit]The following are well-known Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) manufacturing companies[4]NestléProcter & GamblePepsiCoUnileverAB InBevL’OréalCoca-ColaMondelez InternationalKraft HeinzHeinekenKellogg'sRural consumers[edit]Consumers in rural areas typically purchase goods from nearby towns and villages. Recently, there has been a shift in consumer purchase behavior toward purchasing locally that has prompted the need for better local promotional efforts to generate brand awareness in small towns. FMCGs play a large part in the economy, as they are inelastic products that touch every part of consumer life. Businesses that supply FMCGs to a rural community can help provide employment opportunities and drive down the cost of such products in those rural areas. For instance, FMCGs represent the fourth-largest sector in the Indian economy[5] and generate employment for more than three million people in downstream activities.[6]ISIC definition[edit]The retail market for FMCGs includes businesses in the following International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) (Revision 3) categories:[7]ISIC 5211 retail sales in non-specialized storesISIC 5219 other retail sales in non-specialized storesISIC 5220 retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco in specialized storesISIC 5231 retail sales of pharmaceutical and medical goods, cosmetic and toilet articlesISIC 5251 retail sales via mail order housesISIC 5252 retail sales via stalls and marketsISIC 5259 wholesale goodsISIC 5269 wholesale medical prescriptionsSupplier industries for FMCGs include:1511 meat and meat products1512 fish and fish products1513 fruit and vegetables1514 vegetable and animal oils and fats1520 dairy products1531 grain mill products1532 starches and starch products1533 animal feeds1541 bakery products1542 sugar1543 cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery1544 macaroni, noodles, couscous1549 other food products1551 spirits, ethyl alcohol1552 wines1553 malt liquors and malt1554 soft drinks, mineral waters1600 tobacco products2101 pulp, paper and paperboard2102 corrugated paper, containers2109 other articles of paper and paperboard2424 soap and detergents, cleaning preparations, perfumes2430 men's and women's inner garments, shaving gels, deodorants, personal care, home careSee also[edit]Category managementMass productionTrade promotion managementShelf-ready packagingReferences[edit]^ a b Ramanuj Majumdar (2004).
