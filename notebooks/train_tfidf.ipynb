It is hoped that\\nboth volumes will prove useful in the home as well, including as they do a\\ntreatment of the homecrafts, and the related topics now so significant to\\nthe home maker,—the cost and purchasing of foods and clothing, the cost\\nof operating, the management of the home, and questions of state and city\\nsanitation vital to the health of the individual family.\\nThe volume treats specifically of foods, their production, sanitation,\\ncost, nutritive value, preparation, and serving, these topics being\\nclosely interwoven with the practical aspects of household management, and\\nthey are followed by a study of the household budget and accounts, methods\\nof buying, housewifery, and laundering. It includes about 160 carefully\\nselected and tested recipes, together with a large number of cooking\\nexercises of a more experimental nature designed to develop initiative and\\nresourcefulness. Shelter and Clothing deals with the organization and\\nideals of the home, house sanitation, decoration, and furnishing; and\\ntreats in full, textiles, sewing, costume design, and dressmaking.\\nSome of the recipes here given are adapted from those of such authorities\\nas Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Farmer, and Miss Barrows, and others are original\\nand from private sources.\\nThe authors are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to those who have\\nread and criticized the manuscript:\\nProfessorvi\\nMary Swartz Rose of\\nTeachers College, for her criticism and contributions to the book; Miss L.\\nRay Balderston, of Teachers College, for reading the chapters on\\nHousewifery and Laundering; Professor May B. Van Arsdale, of Teachers\\nCollege, for reading the chapters on Food; Professor Van Arsdale, Miss\\nBertha E. Shapleigh, and Miss Mary H. Peacock for their assistance in\\narranging for photographs; Miss Laura B. Whittemore, formerly of Teachers\\nCollege, and Miss Amy L. Logan of the Horace Mann School for criticizing\\nthe manuscript from the point of view of the high school teacher; and also\\nProfessor Hermann Vulté for his kind assistance.',\n",
       " 'vii\\nSUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS\\nThe topics in this volume are so arranged that they can be followed in\\nsequence as the course of study develops through the year, with such\\nmodifications as seem necessary to the teacher in order that the work may\\nbest meet the needs of the pupils. The practice has become quite general\\nof beginning the practical work in the autumn with the preparation and\\npreservation of fruit, especially for those pupils who have had previous\\nwork in foods; and this plan commends itself as being seasonable and as\\nmaking an appeal to the interest of the pupils. The opening chapters\\nfurnish material that is in part preliminary and that may also be studied\\nas the practical work progresses from Chapter V onward. The preparation of\\na meal need not be deferred until all types of dishes have been cooked\\nsingly, as it is possible to prepare a luncheon box, to set an invalid\\ntray, or to serve a simple breakfast quite early in the course, provided\\nthe equipment permits. If the school program allows, it is well to give a\\nperiod to recitation at stated intervals, which would include a discussion\\nof the text and of problems that arise from the laboratory work. The cost\\nof food is a topic to be borne in mind throughout the year. It is an\\nexcellent plan for the pupils to record the current prices of each food\\nmaterial as it is used, and the cost of a given dish for a given number of\\npeople, the topic culminating in a detailed discussion when the chapter on\\nthe cost of food is read. A similar method may be pursued in connection\\nwith the nutritive values of food, the theme developing from lesson to\\nlesson, until the pupils are ready for the chapter\\nonviii\\nmenus and\\ndietaries. An occasional lesson on housewifery or laundering may be\\nintroduced from time to time, if a complete sequence of lessons on these\\ntopics does not seem practicable; and through the year the pupils may be\\nencouraged to keep simple accounts for themselves and in connection with\\nthe supplies of the school kitchen. Those teachers are fortunate who may\\ncoöperate with a school lunch room, thus affording their pupils\\nopportunity for dealing with practical administrative and economic\\nproblems. The way in which the topics are used must of necessity vary with\\nthe previous experience of the pupils, whether or not they have had\\ncookery, chemistry, and physiology, and the teacher will use the exercises\\nat the end of the chapters with freedom, omitting some questions, and\\nadding others as the need arises.\\nThe following references will prove useful to teachers in developing the\\ndifferent topics of the volume:—',\n",

       " 'CHAPTER I\\nFOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS\\nFood problems.—“What shall I plan for the three meals?” is a question as\\nnew each day as the day itself. That many women ask it, and are glad for\\nan answer or a suggestion is proved by a glance at the daily or weekly\\npaper or woman’s magazine, whose publishers know that it pays to print\\nmenus innumerable. Indeed, the daily press is full of signs that the food\\nproblem is an acute one, for the current joke about food prices, the\\naccounts of boycotts by housekeepers, popular articles on nutrition and\\npure foods, and the records of state and national legislation, all show\\nthat as a nation we are awake and seeking a way out of our present\\ndifficulties.\\nDoubtless, the housekeeper has always found the task of supplying food to\\nher family one of the most perplexing, but modern conditions have made the\\ndifficulties manifold when contrasted with olden times. A pretty picture\\nof household management in seventeenth century England is drawn by Sir\\nWalter Scott in “Peveril of the Peak.” The lord of the castle has invited\\nthe village people to a great feast in celebration of the restoration of\\nCharles the Second, and Lady Peveril finds her larder rather low. To be\\nsure, there\\nare2\\ncarp in the pond, and deer in the park, but the beef\\nquestion is puzzling, for the steward does not wish to kill his choice\\nsteer. Then appear in the courtyard two fine oxen, and several wethers, or\\nsheep, gifts from a neighbor, and the menu is complete. Lady Peveril is\\ndescribed as an excellent housekeeper, and doubtless felt burdened by many\\ncares, but how different were her problems from ours, and how simple by\\ncomparison! Beef trusts and the high price of beef, tuberculous cattle,\\nunsanitary transportation and markets were not factors in her problem. In\\nher day, and in the time of our grandmothers, less variety in diet was\\npossible, and less expected except on state occasions; food was not\\ntransported over great distances, and the cost was not so much out of\\nproportion to the average income.\\nNow every large city, and even the small town, is the market of the world.\\nWe have long been accustomed to the importation of oranges and lemons, and\\ndried fruits from distant lands; but now we have peaches and pears from\\nSouth Africa, melons from Spain, pineapples from the Azores, hothouse\\ngrapes from England, and apples from Australia, and in 1913, we read of\\nthe shipment of beef from Argentina. In our own country, early fruits and\\nvegetables travel from the south to the north, so that the season of some\\nfoods is long extended. The large amount of canned food also does away\\nwith the natural limits of the season, and this is further affected by\\ncold storage. Both the quality and the cost of food are modified by these\\nnew methods of commerce, and furthermore, modern methods of manufacture\\nhave changed the quality. In an ideal community these changes would be for\\nthe better, but manufacturers often think more of their own profit than of\\nthe quality of their goods, and as a result adulterations have crept in,\\nmaking necessary the enactment and enforcement of pure food laws. This is\\nby3\\nno means so simple a matter as it seems, for we must first understand\\nwhat pure food really is.\\nInstinct guides somewhat in the selection of food where conditions of\\nliving are simple. Under more complex conditions there must be a\\nscientific study of the whole situation in order that the individual may\\ncope with it. Then, too, with such a variety of foods from which to\\nselect, it is easy to be tempted beyond our means, and to disregard the\\nsimple and the wholesome. We know that it is easy to develop a taste for\\nsome one food in excess, as for instance, sweets or dishes rich in fat and\\ntoo highly flavored, and the physician adds his word here to the plea for\\na study of food and its functions.\\nThe conclusion is this, that the housekeeper who has the welfare of her\\nfamily at heart will not confine her interest in food to cooking processes\\nand new recipes. Good cooks we must have, and our standard of cooking\\ncould easily be raised. But other facts about food are important to-day,\\nand as we learn to prepare and serve food daintily, we must study such\\ntopics as the following:\\nWhat food is, its composition and how it nourishes us; how it is\\nmanufactured and transported; “pure food”; sanitary and convenient\\nmarkets; the cost of food and how to buy; principles of food preparation;\\nsuitable combinations and amounts of food. These topics are all treated in\\nthis volume, and should be considered as important as the actual\\npreparation of food.\\nFood Materials\\nWhat is food?—This would seem to be a difficult question to answer as we\\nlook about a modern grocery or market with its bewildering assortment of\\nfoods. It seems hardly possible to describe such a variety of articles in\\na brief\\nsentence,4\\nor to find a definition that will apply to all. Yet we\\nseem to know instinctively what food is, although we may not find it easy\\nto give a definition. Even the lower animals are guided in selecting food\\nby some natural instinct and seldom make a mistake.\\nA widely used government bulletin gives this definition: “Food is that\\nwhich taken into the body builds tissue or yields energy or does both.”\\nProbably we have learned this in our physiology, and admit it to be true,\\nbut for practical purposes, we need a more complete statement than this.\\nLet us carefully determine what our foods really are, and what elements\\nthey contain, in order that we may select wisely for purposes of\\nnutrition, and also that we may learn how to prepare food materials in a\\nway that will utilize everything in them and waste nothing.\\nVegetable and animal foods.—It is easy to divide food materials in a\\ngeneral way into those derived from the vegetable kingdom and those\\nderived from the animal kingdom. In the vegetable group we have first, the\\ndifferent parts of many plants, and second, substances manufactured from\\nplants. While we do not usually eat the whole of any one plant, yet there\\nis not any part of the plant that we have not adopted as food. We use\\nroots and tubers in beets, carrots, and potatoes, and the onion is a bulb.\\nIn celery and asparagus we eat the plant stalk. Plant leaves give us\\nlettuce and other salads, cabbage and the like. Peas and beans and nuts\\nare seeds, and cauliflower is a part of the flower. The fruit as a whole\\nis familiar in many forms. Manufactured vegetable food materials include\\nflour, meals, breakfast cereals, starch, sugar, molasses and sirups. The\\nanimal kingdom gives us the flesh of animals, fish and shell fish, and\\nsubstances derived from animals, like eggs, milk, and the milk products,\\ncream, butter, and cheese.',\n",
       " '5\\nThese materials vary so much in appearance that they would seem to have\\nnothing in common. If, however, we compare the food of different animals\\nand different races of men, we cannot but conclude that this is a mistaken\\njudgment. We find an animal like the lion feeding entirely upon the flesh\\nof other animals, and a strong creature like the ox, eating nothing but\\ngrass and grain. We also note that one race of men includes meat in its\\ndiet, and another subsists almost entirely upon vegetable food, such as\\nrice and beans. Yet in both cases, these diverse kinds of food accomplish\\nthe same end,—body building and the supplying of energy. Let us study two\\ncommon foods, from the two kingdoms, and see if through this study we can\\ndiscover in what ways they are alike.\\nComparison of milk and beans.—A moment’s thought enables us to see that\\nin milk we have a food that must have all the elements needed in\\nnutrition, since it is the only food taken by many young animals. The baby\\nand the young calf find in it everything that is needed to build the\\ngrowing body, and to give them energy. If you see a young calf frisking\\nabout the field, you can appreciate how well his food supplies his needs.\\nA simple experiment will help us to find some of the substances contained\\nin milk. Let the milk stand until the cream rises on the top. Skim the\\ncream, warm it slightly and beat it with an egg beater. Butter will soon\\n“come,” and butter, we know, is a form of fat. Warm a pint of the skimmed\\nmilk, add to it a dissolved rennet tablet, and set it in a warm place. In\\na short time, the milk becomes solidified to a consistency like that of\\njelly. If allowed to stand longer, a watery liquid will separate itself\\nfrom the solid portion. These are the “curds and whey” that result, also,\\nfrom the souring of milk. The whey can be squeezed out of\\nthe6\\ncurd,\\nleaving it quite dry. We have now found at least three constituents of\\nmilk,—water, fat, and curd.',\n",

       " 'You may then surmise from the sweet taste of milk that sugar is present;\\nthe chemist knows how to obtain it in pure form as “sugar of milk.” The\\nchemist also finds certain mineral substances which remain behind when all\\nthe water is evaporated and the curds and sugar burned away. These mineral\\nsubstances are spoken of by the chemist as “ash,” because this is what\\nremains after burning the other portions of a food material, as ashes\\nremain from a wood fire. Figure 1 shows you these substances in the\\namounts in which each occurs in a pint of milk. The sugar is one of a\\nclass of substances to which the chemist gives the name carbohydrate. To\\nthe substance in the curd that is different from all the other substances\\nin the milk the name “protein” is given.\\nWe will now turn to the composition of beans, for in beans we find food\\nstored up to nourish the young plant, which\\nwe,7\\nalso, appropriate as\\nfood. The composition of both the milk and the beans is given in this\\ntable. Compare also Figures 35 and 41.\\nComposition of Milk and Beans',\n",

       " 'Notice that the substances in the beans are the same in general nature as\\nthose in the milk, although the amounts are different. The water that the\\nyoung plant needs is, of course, supplied from the earth. There is another\\ndifference to note although this is not shown in the table; in the beans\\nthe carbohydrate is of two kinds, sugar and starch.\\nFoodstuffs[1]\\nAll the varieties of food with which we are supplied will be found to\\ncontain some of these substances: protein, fat, carbohydrate, mineral\\nmatter, water; and to these we give the name foodstuffs. Some food\\nmaterials (like the milk and beans just studied) contain all the\\nfoodstuffs, some only one, as in the case of sugar. We can now define food\\nas something that contains one or more of the substances known as\\nfoodstuffs. But what are the foodstuffs themselves?\\nElements in the foodstuffs.—Although we are not chemists, and may not\\neven have taken a course in\\nchemistry,8\\nyet through our nature study or\\nphysiology lessons, we are familiar with the fact that all the materials\\nabout us, including our own bodies and our food, are made up of simple\\nsubstances that we call “elements.” We know, for instance, that coal is\\nchiefly carbon, and we are familiar with such substances as sulphur,\\ncalcium, phosphorus, and iron. We know that the air contains oxygen, which\\nwe inhale, and that we breathe out a combination of carbon and oxygen\\ncalled “carbon dioxide.” Since our bodies are composed of these and other\\nelements, these elements must be supplied by our foods, and therefore, the\\nfoodstuffs in turn are composed of these same elements.\\nProteins, fats, and carbohydrates all contain large amounts of carbon, and\\non this account are called fuel foods. But proteins are distinguished\\nbecause they contain nitrogen in addition, which is found in no other\\nfoodstuff. Sulphur, too, we get only from protein, but we need less of it\\nthan of nitrogen, so we think about the nitrogen and let the sulphur take\\ncare of itself. The nitrogen that we draw in from the air with every\\nbreath, we breathe out again without being able to use it. This element is\\nnecessary to every living cell, but we can make it ours only through our\\nprotein food. Nitrogen is cheapest when obtained from the grains, from\\ndried beans and peas. We pay a higher price for it in milk, eggs, fish,\\nmeat, and nuts. Carbon, which is found in all foodstuffs except water and\\nsome kinds of mineral matter, costs much less, especially when we take it\\nin the form of carbohydrates such as starches and sugars. Oxygen is also\\nabundant in our foods, but we get it even more cheaply in water and by\\nbreathing it in from the air. Phosphorus, iron, and calcium are very\\nimportant elements, but we do not need them in very large quantities. We\\ncan get them cheaply in whole grains, peas and beans, some fruits\\nand9\\ngreen vegetables, but they are worth paying for in milk and eggs. The\\nelements last mentioned are present in the food partly as constituents of\\ncertain proteins and fats, partly as mineral salts. Other elements found\\nas mineral matter are sodium and chlorine (which we take as common salt),\\npotassium, magnesium, and traces of iodine and fluorine. These are all\\nnecessary to keep our bodies in good working order. We shall see later how\\nto select our food materials so as to have all the different elements in\\nthe foodstuffs present in sufficient amounts.\\nFunctions of the Foodstuffs\\nFood for energy.—The first requirement of the body is for fuel, because\\nit has a great deal of work to do. Even when one lies perfectly quiet and\\nappears to be resting, the heart is working to keep up the circulation of\\nthe blood, the chest and diaphragm muscles are working to maintain the\\noxygen supply to the lungs, the alimentary tract is moving food material\\nalong, working to digest it and get rid of waste, and the skeletal muscles\\nare being held up to “tone” so as to be ready for further action. All this\\nwork that we scarcely realize, may be called involuntary. To it we may add\\nall sorts of voluntary movements, from simply speaking a word to turning\\nsomersaults or lifting heavy weights. All work involves energy, which we\\ncan obtain only from the fuel foods, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.\\nEnergy takes different forms. Our supply comes from the sun in the forms\\nof heat and light, and plants store it up in the form of chemical energy\\nwhen they build carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This may be changed\\ninto the forms of work or of heat when we eat the food. Whenever an\\nattempt is made to change chemical energy to work, some of it\\nwill10\\nchange\\nto heat. So in our bodies, the fuel foods, which enable us to do both\\ninvoluntary and voluntary work, furnish heat at the same time, to keep our\\nbodies warm. When we are too cold, we can shiver or run or jump, and thus,\\nby doing more work, get more heat too.\\nThe unit of fuel value.—In our studies of food materials, we must find\\nout just how much energy, or working power, can be obtained from each\\nkind. We must have a measure of energy or fuel value; and just as the inch\\nis a measure of length, and the pound of weight, so the Calorie serves as\\na measure of fuel value. This\\nunit[2]\\nmeasures energy as heat, being the\\namount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of water 1° C. (or 1 pound of\\nwater about 4° F.), but we can express it also as work, being sufficient\\nenergy to raise a 1-pound weight 3087 feet into the air (or 1 ton about\\n11⁄2 feet) if it were possible to convert it into mechanical work without\\nloss. By burning foods in pure oxygen in a vessel placed in water so that\\nall the heat is given off to the water, and then noting the change in\\ntemperature of the water, it is possible to find out just how much energy\\neach will yield. Such a device is called a calorimeter. In the body there\\nis usually a small portion of each kind of foodstuff which escapes\\ndigestion, and protein is not quite so completely burned as in the\\ncalorimeter.

       " 'The standard portion.—Knowing the composition of any food material, it is\\npossible from these figures to\\ncalculate11\\nthe total fuel value, or we can\\nrefer to tables in which this has been calculated, and save ourselves\\nlabor. For comparison of different foods the Standard, or 100-Calorie,\\nPortion is used, as this corresponds very closely with the amount of food\\nfor a single serving in many cases. In the sections treating of different\\nfoods the Standard Portion will be stated.\\nFood for body building.—Every living cell has a little life history of\\nits own, and constantly demands a certain amount of new material to\\nreplace old which it has worn out. Besides this, old cells die, and new\\nones have to be made to replace them. Hence even a full-grown person needs\\nbuilding material, and much more is required in proportion when the person\\nis growing and perhaps adding several ounces a week to his weight. The\\nfoodstuffs which have especial value as building material are protein and\\nmineral matter.\\nFood for body regulating.—To help in the digestion of food, to keep the\\nblood in proper condition, the muscles supple, and all the processes of\\nthe body at their best, ash constituents and water in the diet are\\nnecessary. A tabular summary of the functions of the foodstuffs and an\\noutline of the changes which take place in digestion will be found in the\\nappendix.\\nWe are now able to give a more complete answer to our question, “What is\\nFood?”\\nFood has been said to be that which taken into the body builds tissue or\\nyields energy, or both. The food as a whole must contain all the chemical\\nelements needed by the body, these elements being supplied in substances\\nknown as foodstuffs, viz., protein, fat, carbohydrates, mineral matter or\\nash, water. To be a food, a substance must contain one or all of the\\nfoodstuffs.\\nIt must be noted here that our food materials as\\nbought,12\\ncontain inedible\\nmatter, as in the shells of eggs, the bone of meat, the skins and pods of\\nvegetables. Moreover, the fiber that we eat in vegetable foods is not\\ndigested under ordinary circumstances, but seems rather to serve a useful\\npurpose in giving bulk to our foods.\\nFood adjuncts.—In preparing foods for the table, we have the habit of\\nadding substances to develop or give flavor. With the exception of sugar,\\nwhich we use largely for its agreeable taste, these substances have no\\nnutritive value. They are not hurtful unless used in excess, although\\npepper and other spices sometimes disturb digestion. Pepper, too,\\nirritates a delicate throat.\\nOnly a few flavors are really detected by the sense of taste. These are\\nsalt, sugar, acids, and bitter flavors; and something in the spices that\\ngives a sensation hard to describe, but is unmistakable in an overdose of\\nmustard or horse-radish. “Pungent” describes such a flavor.\\nThe other flavors are really odors, and are detected by the sense of\\nsmell. Have you not at some time seemed to lose the sense of taste when\\nsuffering from a severe cold in the head? Yet even then you could taste\\nsugar, salt, vinegar, and feel the pungency of pepper. These other flavors\\nor odors are due to a volatile oil in the flavoring material, that is, an\\noil that readily evaporates, especially when heated, as distinguished from\\nthe non-volatile oils and fats like olive oil and butter. This is a\\npractical bit of knowledge in our cookery, for whatever passes off as\\nfragrance during the cooking process, is lost as flavor. For instance, to\\ncook vanilla essence in a soft custard is equivalent to throwing most of\\nit away.',\n",

They are made\\nfrom the seeds of certain plants, used whole or ground. Stick\\ncinnamon is a layer of a stem. Ginger is a root.\\nHerbs.—Thyme, mint, sweet marjoram, summer savory are the\\nleaves of old-fashioned pot herbs, used either fresh or dried.\\nThere were many others used in olden days that are not common\\nnow, such as sweet basil and pot marigold. A quite complete list\\nwill be found nowadays in any good seed catalogue. These herbs\\nare used with meat dishes.\\nVegetable flavors.—Celery seeds and stalks, onions, leek and\\ngarlick, carrots and turnips, all contain flavoring oils, and we\\nuse them for their flavors in small portions, in meat dishes.\\nEssences.—The oils of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon and\\norange peel are dissolved in alcohol, and used in liquid form in\\ncakes and desserts. Violet leaves and violet essence are\\nsometimes used, but are a fad as a flavor. Rose water made from\\nrose leaves is an old-fashioned flavoring, used infrequently now\\nin blancmanges. The fresh leaf of a rose geranium gives a\\npleasing flavor, for occasional use. Chocolate, coffee, and tea\\nare used for flavorings as well as for beverages.\\nColoring substances.—These come of many colors made from\\naniline dyes, and while probably not often hurtful, they should\\nbe used only in sweets and candies, and very seldom, if ever. It\\nis better to depend on natural fruit coloring when color is\\nwanted.\\nThe fine art of cooking is to develop the natural flavor of each foodstuff\\nby the proper application of heat, and never to use these condiments and\\nflavorings in excess. The artist in cookery has a gift for flavoring,\\nsomewhat as the painter has for color.\\nBeverages.—The dictionary defines “beverage” as “drink of any kind.” The\\nword is used in different forms in several languages and is traced back to\\nthe Latin\\nbibere,14\\nto drink. The common beverages will be studied in\\ndetail in connection with their preparation. They have slight nutritive\\nvalue, save for the added milk, cream, and sugar.

Water\\npower is the only practicable method so far, and to make it permanently\\navailable we must conserve the forests still remaining to us, and thus\\nsafeguard the sources of our rivers.\\nAnother effort toward economy is seen in the use for fuel of waste\\nproducts treated in some way to make them readily combustible. The briquet\\nis used in Europe where the fuel supply is limited. It is made of sawdust\\nor waste coal,\\nwith34\\nsome petroleum, tar, resin, or other substance,\\nheated together and molded. Good briquets yield a large amount of heat in\\nproportion to bulk and weight. The problem here, as with all waste, is to\\nfind a manufacturing process that will make the product cheap enough to be\\npractical for common use.\\nIt is a natural impulse to use lavishly whatever is at hand in abundance,\\nand it is only a highly civilized community that takes thought for the\\neconomy of the future. Considered only from a selfish point of view,\\nhowever, with coal and petroleum at the high prices that are likely to\\nprevail, the saving of fuel is one of our most important economies.\\nThe common fuels.—Coal is of two kinds, anthracite and bituminous, or\\nhard and soft. Hard coal of good quality has 90 per cent or more of\\ncarbon, and burns with little flame. Soft coal contains as much as 18 per\\ncent of flame-making substances, and gives off a heavy smoke. Hard coal is\\ntherefore cleaner, but it is more costly than soft coal, because the\\nsupply is smaller. The most important anthracite mines are found in the\\neastern United States, and hard coal is used more in this section than\\nelsewhere. Good hard coal may be recognized by its glossy black color and\\nbright surfaces. It is sold under different names taken often from the\\nlocality where it is mined. There are two kinds, one leaving a reddish\\nash, and the other a white. The red ash coal burns more freely than the\\nwhite ash and the ash is heavier and therefore cleaner. The price is\\nhigher per ton or bag.\\nCoal is sorted in different sizes, a medium size being best for the\\nordinary range. Poor coal has slaty pieces in it, that will not burn but\\nbreak up and mingle with the ashes. You can learn to detect it by the\\nslaty color. Clinkers are formed by unburnable minerals, mixed with the\\ncoal,\\nthat35\\nmelt and stick together, and even adhere to the lining or the\\ngrate. They are not often troublesome in the cooking range.\\nCoal is measured by the ton of two thousand pounds avoirdupois. A common\\nhod of coal holds about thirty pounds. Coal should be bought in large\\nquantity, and stored away in summer, if possible. The retail dealer in the\\ncity often charges an exorbitant sum for coal by the bag, so that the\\nbuyer of small quantities pays a much higher price for a ton bought in\\nthis way. The wholesale price of coal has increased on an average about 13\\nper cent since 1900.\\nCoke is the solid substance remaining after gas has been made from\\ncertain kinds of coal, and is sometimes sold by gas companies, as a\\nby-product. It is light, and therefore easy to handle and does not smoke,\\nbut it burns out quickly, and the fire of coke requires frequent\\nreplenishing. It is sold by the bag, or in large quantities by the ton,\\nalso sometimes by the chaldron, an old English measure for coal,\\ncontaining from thirty-two to thirty-six bushels.\\nGas was used for illuminating long before it came into common use for\\nheating and cooking. Commercial gas manufactured for both lighting and\\ncooking is really a mixture of various gases. One method produces it from\\nbituminous coal heated in retorts. Another method gives “water gas,” by\\npassing steam through heated coal. The value of gas will depend upon the\\ncomponents of the mixture, and the manufacturer has an opportunity to make\\nan inferior gas unless the law stipulates what the quality shall be.\\nThe small town or country dweller may use a gas machine on the premises,\\nthe gas to be stored or generated in some tank in the ground, and piped\\ninto the house. Acetylene, a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is used in\\nthis way. Acetylene has a low flashing point, and there is question as\\nto36\\nits safety. One firm sends a mixed gas of good quality in metal bottles\\nto the consumer, the bottles being placed in a metal closet above ground\\noutside the house. The firm claims that an explosion has never occurred.\\nGas is measured by the cubic foot, and its price estimated per 1000 cubic\\nfeet. The amount is recorded on a meter as the gas passes into the house.\\nSee Fig. 13. It is an easy matter to learn to read a meter, and every one\\nshould do so who uses gas. Always compare the gas bill with the amount\\nrecorded by the meter. If the gas bill becomes larger than usual, and you\\nfeel sure that the consumption has been normal, report the matter to the\\ncompany. A meter may be out of order, and need repair.',\n",

       " 'To read the meter.—Figure 13 shows the three dials found on the face of\\na gas meter. The arrows show the direction. The dial at the right\\nindicates 100 cubic feet between the numbers, the middle dial 1000 and the\\nleft-hand dial 10,000. The dials in this figure record 53,250 cubic feet.\\nThe price of gas varies from eighty cents to a dollar and a half per\\nthousand cubic feet. “Eighty-cent gas” is the hope of many a consumer. At\\na dollar and a half it is not a cheap fuel.',\n",
       " '37\\nGas does away with the handling of coal and ashes in the kitchen and is\\nthus a clean and labor-saving fuel. It gives an intense heat the moment\\nthe flame is lighted and this heat is easily regulated in a well-made\\nstove. The flame should burn with a clear blue or greenish color. With a\\nproperly constructed stove only a small percentage of the heat is lost. In\\nall these points it has the advantage over coal. The comparative cost is\\nstudied in the problems on page 53.\\nNatural gas is used in those regions where it occurs, piped to the house\\nfrom a central source. It is found in limited areas only, and in some\\nplaces has already been exhausted.\\nCoal oil, or petroleum, sometimes found oozing from crevices in rocks,\\nor even floating on water, is a natural inflammable oil stored in the\\nearth. It was known in ancient Persia, Greece, and Rome, but did not\\nbecome of great commercial importance until the middle of the nineteenth\\ncentury. It is now obtained by boring wells, and is found in great\\nquantities in certain regions of the country. The crude oil yields many\\nproducts valuable in the arts, medicine, and manufacture. Kerosene is\\nthe substance useful as a fuel and for giving light. When of good quality\\nit is nearly colorless, and the flashing point should be 149° F., or 65°\\nC. This flashing point is the temperature at which the vapor from the\\nkerosene explodes or flashes. If the vapor flashes at a point lower than\\nthis, it means that the oil has not been sufficiently refined; that is, in\\nthe process of manufacture the substances that flash at a low temperature\\nhave not been removed, and therefore the oil is less safe.\\nKerosene is sold by the gallon or barrel. The price for a good quality is\\nabout seventy cents for a five-gallon can. By the barrel a saving is made\\nof several cents a gallon. It is useful as a fuel to those housekeepers\\nwho cannot have gas, and who find it a convenient substitute for coal in\\nthe38\\nsummer. With the new blue-flame stoves it gives an intense heat,\\neasily regulated. There is no heavy labor involved in its use, but even\\nthe best stove requires constant care and watchfulness. It is not so clean\\nand easy to use as gas. The kerosene supply should be kept in a cool\\nplace, and stoves and lamps should never be filled by candle or lamplight.\\nGasolene is used as a fuel for cooking in some places, but in others the\\nfire insurance companies have such strict rules in regard to it that its\\nuse is practically prohibited. It is more volatile than kerosene, and its\\nflashing point is very low. Kerosene is much safer for household use.\\nAlcohol is used with the chafing dish. Denatured alcohol is so cheap in\\nGermany that it is used in large and especially adapted stoves for cooking\\npurposes. There are denatured alcohol stoves on the market here, but they\\nare little used.\\nCharcoal, wood partially burnt out, is little used for domestic purposes\\nnow.\\nThe relative value of the common fuels is stated in quantities as follows,\\nbut this is of course dependent on the quality of the coal and the gas.\\nOne thousand feet of gas about equals from fifty to sixty pounds of coal,\\nor four and one half gallons of kerosene; and one half ton of coal\\napproximates a cord of wood.\\nThose who may be interested will find a fuller discussion of fuels and\\nfuel values in Snell’s “Elementary Household Chemistry.”\\nElectricity is not a fuel, but is classed here as a source of heat. It\\nmay be supplied for cooking purposes by any company that furnishes\\nelectric light, and should be available in the country wherever an\\nelectric trolley runs. The energy supplied is measured and paid for by the\\nkilowatt; that is, one thousand watts. The terms used for electrical\\nmeasurements cannot be really understood until one has\\nstudied39\\nelectricity. It may be said, however, that the\\nampere[6]\\nis the unit of\\ncurrent strength, the volt is the unit of electrical pressure or\\nelectromotive force, the watt is the unit of electrical power and the\\nbasis of payment for current supplied for heating or lighting.\\nVoltage, amperage, and watt or kilowatt are the terms in common use. If\\nyou read the circulars that advertise electric cooking apparatus, you will\\nfind the request to state the voltage of your electric current in ordering\\na piece of apparatus. Or again, the number of watts used per hour is\\ngiven, with the catalogue number and the size of an electric stove.\\nThe cost of electricity per kilowatt (usually from ten to fifteen cents)\\nvaries in different localities.\\nThe great advantage of electricity is that little heat is lost in\\nradiation, and that the degree of heat is well under control. There are\\nalso no products of combustion present, and this is the only source of\\nheat for cooking of which this is true. Both gas and kerosene vitiate the\\nair to some extent.\\nCooking apparatus.—The wastefulness of cooking operations, past and\\npresent, is due largely to the defects of the apparatus used. The open\\nfireplace for wood, and the open grate for coal, are two arrangements that\\npermit most of the heat to pass up the chimney, and into the room. See\\nFrontispiece and Fig. 14. In Fig. 14 there is illustrated at the right a\\nbrick oven with a flue opening into the chimney. This was one of the\\nearliest inventions for saving fuel and heat. This oven was lined with\\nbrick or stone, and the fire of wood was built in it, and allowed to\\nremain until it\\nhad40\\nburned out. The coals and ashes were removed, and\\nwhen the brick had cooled somewhat cakes and pies were put in to bake.\\nThis oven retained its heat for twenty-four hours, and beans put in\\nSaturday afternoon were taken out hot for the Sunday morning breakfast.\\nThe method was clumsy, but a good heat saver.',\n",

This does not\\nmean that the stove which gives the most intense heat is the best,\\nalthough some stoves seem to be constructed with that as the aim.\\nLet us consider some of the methods of saving heat, and study different\\nkinds of apparatus with this knowledge in mind.',\n",
       " '42\\nWe recall the fact, first, that some substances are good conductors of\\nheat, and others\\npoor.[7]\\nIf you hold a metal poker in your hand, and\\nplace the other end in red hot coals, you will realize that metal is a\\nrapid conductor of heat. If the poker has a wooden handle, the heat of the\\ncoals does not readily reach your hand, for the wood is a poor conductor.\\nMoreover, this good conductor is a poor holder of heat, the heat radiating\\nrapidly from it into the surrounding air, but the poor conductor, once\\nthoroughly heated, cools off slowly.',\n",
       " 'You can think of many illustrations from your daily life. Why do\\nyou prefer a woolen blanket on a cool night, rather than a linen\\nsheet, merely? Why do you use a cloth holder in ironing? What is\\nthe principle of a hot water bottle? Air is a poor conductor.\\nCan you think of an illustration of this? What is the principle\\nof a thermos bottle?\\nIt is not difficult to see how these facts apply in our cooking apparatus.\\nFrom an oven with metal sides heat is lost by radiation. In a double oven,\\nwith an air space between the inner and outer part, some heat is saved. If\\nthe outer cover is of some non-conducting material, even less radiation\\ntakes place. This is the principle of the oven devised by Mr. Edward\\nAtkinson. Here the inner oven is of sheet iron, and the outer covering of\\na non-conducting material, some composition with wood pulp or paper as the\\nbasis. If in this way heat can be trapped, as it were, in an oven, it will\\nfollow that less heat will have to be supplied, and we can use a smaller\\namount of fuel. This is the case in the Atkinson oven (Fig. 16), where the\\nsource of heat is either a kerosene lamp, or a small Bunsen burner of the\\nrose type, which uses only a small amount of gas.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 16.—The Atkinson cooker.',\n",
       " '43\\nAnother illustration of the conserving of heat by the prevention of\\nradiation is in the fireless cooker. This is a method used in Sweden in\\nsimple form, and adapted and improved to suit modern needs. Heat is\\nsupplied in the first place by gas or kerosene, and the water in the\\nvessel containing the food is raised to the boiling point, and held there\\nin some cases for a few minutes. The vessel is then placed in the\\n“cooker,” which is a box with thick walls of some non-conducting material,\\nand the heat already present is sufficient to finish the cooking process,\\nsince the radiation is very slow. In some cookers a heated stone is\\nintroduced to raise the temperature slightly. Both of these devices are\\nexcellent for the long, slow cooking that seems to mellow the food\\nmaterial and develop the flavors that do not result from rapid cooking.\\nAt the same time, we need rapid processes, such as broiling and toasting,\\nwhich give characteristic flavors. To meet this double need, a new type of\\ngas stove has been made. See Fig. 17.',\n",

There is no good reason why stoves\\nembodying44\\nthis\\nsame principle should not be used with kerosene, and with the electric\\ncurrent. Improved stoves of this type will be constructed, and certainly\\nwill tend toward great economy of fuel.\\nOne method of saving fuel is by the use of a steam cooker, which\\nconsists of a series of compartments, one above another, containing\\nseveral kinds of food, all to be cooked over the same burner, either gas\\nor kerosene, or on one section of the top of the coal range when space is\\nbeing used for the wash boiler or irons.\\nIt requires intelligence to use such devices, and those who lack it cling\\nobstinately to hot fires and violent cooking.',\n",
       " '45\\nThe coal range.—Progress is slow, and the coal range will not be\\nabolished at present. Figure 18 is an example of a good range as easy to\\nmanage as possible. The coal box at (1) has a lining that prevents the\\niron from burning out. The air enters at (2) and passes out at (3), when\\nthe fire is first made. When it is necessary to heat the oven, a damper is\\nclosed at (4), and the heated air then passes around the oven in the\\ndirection of the arrows. The coal is put in at (5) and the ashes shaken\\ndown at (6). Larger ranges, resting upon the floor, have a “dump” for the\\nashes directly into the ash box in the cellar, and some makes have a\\ndevice for operating this with the foot. The coal stove involves\\nthe46\\nlabor of bringing in coal and taking out ashes, and space must be given\\nto the coal bin and ash pit. A range of this size would serve for a family\\nof five or six. It requires from 2 to 3 hods per day. A hood should be\\nplaced above a large range, whether coal or gas.',\n",

There is an opening in\\nthe pipe, near the stopcock, which admits the air, that it may mix with\\nthe gas, and give the blue flame. If there is not enough air, the flame\\nburns with a yellow color, and smokes. If there is too much air, there is\\na roaring sound, and the flame “pulls back” and burns with a smoky yellow\\nflame, and disagreeable odor. There is a valve always to regulate the air\\nsupply for each burner. Figure 20 shows a burner removed from the range.\\n(1) is the hollow, star-shaped chamber which gives space for the thorough\\nmixing of the gas with the air.

Ranges are built also for using either gas or coal. A range of\\nthe size pictured, with four large burners on the top, will serve for a\\nfamily of five or six, if the work is well planned. The oven burner\\nconsumes 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the top burners 2 cubic feet each,\\nand the simmering burner somewhat less. This is estimated for a burner\\nturned on full.',\n",
       " 'To manage a gas stove.—Before lighting the top or oven burners\\nsee that the stopcocks are all tight, with no escaping gas. To\\nlight the top burners, strike the match, turn on the stopcock,\\nand touch the match to the gas when it is flowing well. A\\ndisagreeable49\\n“popping” follows if the match is applied to the\\nburner before the gas flows. For lighting the oven, a “leader”\\nburner at the side of the stove acts as a taper. Open the oven\\ndoors, and the door below, strike the match, turn on the leader,\\nand light it, turn on the back burner, and then the front\\nburner, and turn out the leader. The so-called explosion of a\\ngas stove is due to the sudden lighting of a quantity of gas\\nunder the oven that has collected without being lighted.\\nThe important point in managing a gas stove is to keep the\\nstopcock turned so that the flame is low. The full flame is\\nneeded only when water is being brought to the boiling point,\\nand for the first heating of the oven. The low flame should be\\nprotected from draft. Many gas stoves now have a small simmering\\nburner that is more useful than the large burner. Another point\\nin the use of the stove is the prevention of the “boiling over”\\nfrom some kettle. The low flame helps here, and it is also\\nnecessary that the kettles should not be too full. “Boiling\\nover” clogs the burners, and makes necessary the frequent\\ncleaning of the pan underneath the burners.\\nThe oven burner should be lighted from five to ten minutes\\nbefore the oven is wanted, depending upon the intensity of the\\nflames. After the food has been put in the oven, allow a few\\nminutes, not more than five, for the food to heat through, and\\nthen turn the flame as low as possible. Often, one burner can be\\nturned out. This you have to learn by experience. When toasting\\nor broiling is the process, light the oven burner before using,\\nbecause the work is performed by the heated iron as well as by\\nthe gas flame. Leave the lower door open, as bread toasts or\\nmeat broils, to hasten the browning process, for it is the\\noxygen of the air that causes the browning. Some coal ovens have\\na damper for admitting air for this same purpose and though some\\nflavor is lost in this way by evaporation, the amount is\\nnegligible in a quick cooking process. The Atkinson oven is so\\ntightly closed, that food does not acquire a rich brown in it.\\nAn opening at the top is available when a delicate brown is\\nwanted. It is true, however, that the slow process with a\\nminimum of evaporation gives a flavor that compensates for the\\nbrown color and flavor. All burners should be removed if the\\nholes seem clogged and be boiled out in a solution of washing\\nsoda, two tablespoonfuls to a gallon of water. Do not blacken\\nthe burners.',\n",
       " '50\\nKerosene stoves.—The best type is a blue-flame stove with a wick.\\nKerosene stoves are made with no wick, the kerosene being vaporized just\\nbefore it reaches the burner, but such a stove requires occasional pumping\\nto force the kerosene into the vaporizing chamber, and on the whole is\\nless satisfactory than the stove with the wick. The heat is intense from\\nthis blue flame, and the burner is economical of the fuel. The small\\nkerosene stoves, burning with a yellow flame are always inclined to smoke,\\nand difficult to keep clean. A three- or four-burner oil stove with a\\nportable oven will do the cooking in summer for a family of five or six.\\nOne burner consumes a gallon of oil in 15 hours. Portable double ovens are\\nfurnished with such stoves.\\nThe kerosene stove is cheaper to operate than a gas range, even with\\nkerosene at fourteen cents a gallon, but the heat is not under such\\nperfect control, and the stove requires more work to keep it clean.',\n",
       " 'The one important point in the management of this blue-flame\\nwick stove is to keep the flame down by having the wick low, and\\nwhere it belongs. The cylinder around the burner prevents the\\nescape of heat and carries it to the utensil above. A careless\\nperson, by raising the wick too high, and producing a yellow\\nsmoky flame, makes much trouble for herself. It is important to\\nfill the tank without spilling a drop of kerosene, and to keep\\nevery part of the stove well washed off with soap and water. The\\nwick should be rubbed off occasionally, never cut, and if an\\nodor becomes perceptible, the burner should be taken apart and\\nboiled in a solution of washing soda and water. The wick will\\nneed to be renewed at intervals, depending upon the amount of\\nuse that it has. With care a stove of this kind is clean and\\nodorless.\\nElectric apparatus.—Figure 21 shows a table arranged for cooking by\\nelectricity, each piece of apparatus having its own connection.

In cookery the word is\\nused in the same sense; for example, one may say that an important\\nprinciple to bear in mind when cooking with any fat is that the fats may\\nbe melted without decomposition, but when too strongly heated they begin\\nto decompose with the production of acrid and irritating products.\\nSometimes, however, we speak of “principles of cookery” in a broader and\\nsomewhat less exact sense to indicate the general purposes of cooking\\noperations, as when we say that the most important principle of vegetable\\ncookery is to soften the fiber without destroying the flavor or dissolving\\naway the ash constituents of the vegetable.\\nThat is, the change either chemical or physical that takes place in a\\ncertain foodstuff by the application of heat or cold or by the use of a\\nfermentation process may be referred to as the underlying, working\\nprinciple. We shall study in detail these changes as we experiment with\\nand prepare each food material, but a general statement of the effect of\\nheat on various foodstuffs will be helpful here.\\nProtein.—There are several forms of protein, with differences that we\\ncan understand only after a thorough study of chemistry. The most\\nimportant proteins in meat,\\nfish,55\\neggs, milk, old beans and peas\\ncoagulate, or become slightly harder or firmer at a temperature below the\\nboiling point of water. We shall perform an experiment to show this while\\nstudying the egg. There is no marked chemical change; that is, the protein\\nis not changed to another substance.\\nFats.—Solid fats are liquefied by heat, and freed from the tissue that\\ncontains them in animal fats like suet.\\nWhen a fat begins to smoke with heat, a chemical change is taking place.\\nIf intense heat is continued, all the hydrogen and oxygen are driven off\\nand pure carbon remains. When the fat is “brown,” giving the flavor we\\nlike, a part of the oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off. The\\n“boiling” of fat in a kettle is ordinarily due to the boiling of the water\\ncontained in the fat.\\nStarch.—Starch occurs in the form of granules. See Fig. 39. In boiling\\nwater, the granule expands and finally bursts, and frees the content, the\\npure starch, and the whole mass thickens.\\nBoiled with an acid the starch is changed to dextrin, a substance\\nresembling a gum, and the mixture becomes thin; and this process continued\\nchanges the dextrin to dextrose.\\nWith intense “dry” heat, as in toasting, the granule expands and opens,\\nand the contents change to dextrin. Continued heat reduces the starch to\\npure carbon. The brown color and pleasant flavor in toast are a stage on\\nthe road to carbon.\\nSugar.—Sugar first melts with heat, then begins to decompose, giving\\noff water. This is also a stage on the road to pure carbon. Caramel, a\\nfamiliar flavor, is sugar in the brown stage, with the water partly driven\\noff.\\nThe art in applying intense heat to fat, starch, and sugar is to know the\\nstopping point,—to reach the “brown taste” and stop short of the “burnt\\ntaste.”',\n",
       " '56\\nMineral matter.—The “ash” remains for the most part unchanged by heat,\\nbut may be lost in the water in which vegetables and meat are cooked if\\nthe water is thrown away.\\nVegetable fiber is softened by heat and moisture, and the protein,\\nstarch, fat, and sugar are freed, making them available for our digestion\\nand nutrition.\\nMeat fiber softens at a low temperature, that is, below the boiling\\npoint of water, with moisture; continued intense heat shrinks and hardens\\nit. A tender steak fried with fat in a hot pan will soon resemble sole\\nleather.\\nThe technique of food preparation.—From the moment the food materials\\nenter the kitchen until the unusable portions are destroyed or carried\\naway, there is a best way of working with them at each step, and the sum\\nof these may be said to make a good technique. This technique will include\\ncleanliness first and foremost, then skill in the use of tools, judgment\\nin managing cooking apparatus and in applying heat in cooking processes,\\nand accuracy and rapidity of execution. It will also include or add to\\nitself the æsthetic element, the fine art of flavoring, the dainty\\ngarnishing of a dish. Moreover, this technique is the method of putting\\ninto practice some basic, scientific principle. To illustrate:',\n",
       " 'The principle that underlies toast-making is threefold,—\\nHeat evaporates moisture throughout the slice of bread.\\nIntense heat changes the content of the starch granules on the\\nsurface of the slice of bread to dextrin.\\nIntense heat, long continued, will change first the surface\\nstarch, and then all, to carbon (charcoal).\\nA good technique will secure the first two, and avoid the\\nthird and includes,—\\nThe selection of bread already partially dry.\\nThe cutting of bread into slices of uniform thickness.\\nRegulating the source of heat.',\n",
       " '57\\nPlacing the slices firmly in a toaster, or on a fork, or evenly\\non a rack when toasting by gas.\\nKeeping the toast at a distance from the source of heat that\\ninsures a steady but not too rapid change.\\nTurning the toaster or the slices to cook each surface in turn\\nand thus to make the process slower.\\nStopping the process before carbon is formed and the toast\\n“burned.” (A good technique does not include scraping the\\ntoast!)\\nThe æsthetic element in toast-making might be a pretty shape\\nof the slices, say triangular pieces, and a dainty arrangement.\\nIn this case and in others it is true that the result of a good\\ntechnique is æsthetic, in that correct manipulation while\\nsecuring the desired chemical change also develops the pleasing\\ngolden brown that makes the toast so attractive.\\nThe care of food materials.—When food materials are delivered, have\\nreceptacles ready for each kind of food. (See kitchen furnishing.) Attend\\nfirst to perishable foods. Wash and dry milk and cream bottles before\\nputting them in the refrigerator. Treat eggs in the same way. This is also\\na good plan with lemons and other skin fruit, unless the quantity is too\\nlarge, in which case they should not be put into the refrigerator. Remove\\nwrappings from meat, poultry, and fish; wipe them with a soft cloth,\\ndipped in salt and water, dry them, and place them in the ice box. Wash\\nthe cloth thoroughly and dry it. Fish should be covered that its odor may\\nnot affect other food. Vegetables like lettuce, celery, and spinach should\\nbe washed and picked over immediately, and the poor portions thrown away.\\nAll semi-perishable foods should be put in a cool, dry place, and the\\nnon-perishables in their separate receptacles. (See page 20.) Do not keep\\nanything in brown paper bags, but save these bags for other uses.\\nHave a regular time for inspecting and for cleaning all the places and\\nreceptacles where food is kept. Do not allow any spilled food material to\\nremain anywhere, and do not\\ntolerate58\\nthe presence of any material, cooked\\nor uncooked, that shows the least taint. A keen sense of smell is a good\\nservant here.\\nThe processes of food preparation.—With kitchen in order, tools ready,\\nand food materials at hand, we are ready for the actual food preparation.\\nA distinction is to be made between cookery and cooking. Cookery includes\\nall the steps necessary to produce the finished product, while cooking is\\nthe actual application of heat, only one step of the whole process,\\nthough, indeed, one of the most important and difficult. The order of\\nprocedure in food preparation is as follows:\\nSee first that the stove is ready (Chapter IV). Then comes the choice and\\nstudy of the recipe or the method of cooking. The word “recipe” is from a\\nLatin word meaning “take.” Follow this advice and “take” or bring together\\non the work table whatever materials are needed. Decide upon the necessary\\nutensils, and place them conveniently near. As you gather the materials\\ntogether you will measure and weigh the exact amounts. Do this before you\\nbegin the putting together or mixing. Sometimes instead of mixing, the\\nnecessary process is paring, or scraping, or cutting, each with its own\\nbest way. Then follows the application of heat. Some foods are then served\\nat once, others must be carefully put away after cooling. Or again, there\\nis no application of heat, for instance, when the freezing temperature is\\nused in ice cream; or in a salad, or fruit preparation where cooling in\\nthe refrigerator is the next step. The technique of preparing a meal and\\nserving will be found in Chapter XVI.\\nHow to study a recipe.—Remember that a recipe is a bit of experience\\nhanded down for us to make useful. Some one experimented at some time long\\nago, perhaps failed at first, tried again, finally succeeded, and passed\\non the result by word of mouth to others. There were doubtless\\ngood59\\ncooks\\nlong before there were printed or written recipes. Some recipes, however,\\nhave been handed down from Roman times, and recipes were printed as early\\nas the sixteenth century. Modern recipes are much more accurate than the\\nold, as you may see if you have opportunity to read some old cook book.\\nAt first in using a recipe follow its directions exactly. Notice the\\nproportions, and read carefully the directions for combining the\\ningredients, noting those points that are most important. Have the whole\\nprocess well in mind before you begin work. Do not let it be necessary to\\nrefer to the printed page at every move you make. This is poor technique.\\nWhen the use of a recipe is preceded by some simple experiment that makes\\nthe basic principle clear, it is much easier to use the recipe with\\nintelligence.\\nWhen you are no longer a novice you may take liberties with a recipe, even\\na new one, scanning it with a critical eye, and perhaps giving it a cool\\nwelcome. It may not be new at all! For this is the secret of\\nrecipes,—there are really only a few, and the key to their use is the\\nrecognition of the old in the new garb, and the having of a few type\\nrecipes clearly in mind. Each kind of prepared dish has one, or two, or\\nthree basic forms or mixtures. Learn these, and then with experience you\\nwill become inventive, and make your own variations. For example, there\\nare but two kinds of cake,—those made with butter (or other fat) and\\nthose without butter (the sponge cake). You will not attempt to memorize\\nmany recipes, but you will find that in studying these type recipes you\\nhave learned a few proportions so well that you cannot forget them. When\\nyou have reached this stage of freedom you will still do exact work, but\\nyour ingenuity and taste will have free play and you will not\\nbe60\\ntied to\\nother people’s recipes. But you cannot well begin at this end.\\nMake some plan for recording new recipes that you test and find good. It\\nmay be a printed recipe, or one that a friend gives you. The most\\nconvenient plan is a recipe box or card file. The guide cards are arranged\\nalphabetically, and each recipe is either pasted upon a card or written\\nupon it. This plan makes it easy to discard an old recipe, or one that has\\nproved unsatisfactory, and to keep new recipes in alphabetical order,\\nwhich cannot be done in a book. A loose-leaf book is made for recipes,\\nalphabetized at the side, with envelopes for holding cuttings that may be\\nfastened in between the pages. This is a little less easy to use than the\\ncard file.\\nWeighing and measuring.—The system is “Avoirdupois,” sixteen ounces to\\nthe pound. Learn to read the scales exactly, and when weighing, always\\nallow for the weight of the utensil or paper holding the food. Weighing is\\nmore accurate than measuring, but it is slower, and the measuring can be\\nmade sufficiently accurate for most daily work. Weighing is necessary in\\nthe cookery of large pieces of meat and with poultry in order to estimate\\ncorrectly the time for cooking; and it is more convenient to weigh than\\nmeasure when preserving fruit if the quantities are large. Also in\\nstudying food values it is usually necessary to weigh the articles of\\nfood.\\nThe measures in common use are the saltspoon, teaspoon, and tablespoon,\\nthe half-pint measuring cup, the pint, quart, and gallon of liquid\\nmeasure. The saltspoon is not accurate, and it is better to use some\\nfraction of a teaspoonful. Teaspoons and tablespoons of a standard volume\\nmay be found at some furnishing shops. The spoons in common use vary in\\nsize, and the only way to approximate accuracy is to use the level\\nspoonful.61\\nThis is now the common practice. Tin and glass half-pint cups\\nare made gauged in quarters and thirds. Those commonly on sale sometimes\\nmeasure more than one fourth of the standard quart. Inquire when you buy\\nif the cup measure is standard,—that is, exactly one half standard pint.\\nA quart measure, with four divisions, is necessary for careful work. A\\npint measure is convenient, but not necessary if you have the quart and\\nhalf-pint measuring cup.\\nIt is necessary to know the relation of these different weights and\\nmeasures to each other. While you may find tables of relative weight and\\nmeasures in many cookbooks, it is much better for you to work out a few of\\nthe most useful for yourself, making careful record in your notebooks.\\nThe following abbreviations are short cuts in reading and writing.',\n",
       " 'oz.   = ounce\\nlb.   = pound\\nssp.  = saltspoonful\\ntsp.  = teaspoonful\\ntbsp. = tablespoonful\\ncp.   = cup\\npt.   = pint\\nqt.   = quart\\ngall. = gallon',\n",

An old-fashioned recipe for sponge cake reads thus: Take the\\nweight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour.\\nTranslate this into measures.\\nPreparing and mixing.—Food materials that are not to be mixed with others\\nstill need special preparation before heat is applied.',\n",

Perhaps some root was cooked in the hot\\nashes. This primitive method of roasting we still use in camp fires, and\\nin modified form wherever food is directly exposed to the heat of coal or\\ngas. Water could not be a cooking medium until man advanced at least to\\nthe first stage of pottery making, when some rude basket daubed with clay\\nwas water-tight and sufficiently heat proof.\\nApplication of heat is the most difficult stage of the whole process of\\ncookery. It is so easy to have the heat too intense, or too low, to expose\\nthe food for too long or too short a time to its action. Most of our\\napparatus fails to give us a uniform heat, the tendency being to an\\nincrease or decrease of temperature. Since the boiling temperature of\\nwater remains at 212° F., boiling is an easy process to manage, provided\\nthe water does not boil out. The presence of water insures a low or\\nmoderate temperature always.\\nIt requires patience and time to learn how to bring\\nthis65\\nnatural force of\\nheat under control. One novice who had allowed a flour paste to boil over\\nand burn while she was looking out of the window remarked: “We may forget,\\nbut they never do!”—a pretty way of stating the steady working of\\nnature’s forces which we can harness for our use only by the exercise of\\nreason and will and constant watchfulness. The unintelligent cook is\\nimpatient of slow processes, and cannot believe that food will finally be\\n“done” unless the water is at a “galloping” boil, and a red-hot fire is\\nkeeping the oven at burning temperature.\\nLook upon the application of heat as a continuation of nature’s slow\\nripening process, a softening of tough fibers and a development of\\npleasing flavors. For why do we cook at all except for these reasons?\\nPrimitive man thought only that the food had a better taste. He may have\\ndecided, too, that it was easier to masticate; but we have learned that in\\nsome cases we may, with right methods of cooking, make it easier to digest\\nfarther on in the alimentary canal. Modern science carries us a step\\nfarther and teaches us that cooking destroys lower organisms, such as\\nharmful bacteria that may be present, and even animal parasites in meats.\\nWe cook, therefore, to improve the appearance of food, to develop\\nflavors, to render some foodstuffs more digestible and to destroy\\nmicroörganisms.\\nWe have at our command the following processes:',\n",
       " 'Heat direct from coal, charcoal, wood, or gas.\\nToasting.—Surfaces of food exposed and turned for browning.\\nBroiling.—Thin portions of meat or fish exposed and turned\\nfor searing, browning, and short cooking of the interior.\\nRoasting.—Thicker cuts of meat exposed and turned frequently\\nfor searing, browning, and gradual cooking of the interior.

Meat and poultry cooked\\nin an oven are baked and not roasted, although we use the word\\n“roast” for this method.\\nBraising.—Cooking meat in a heated oven in a closed vessel,\\nwith a supply of water to keep down the temperature. This might\\nbe called an “oven stew.”\\nThese methods are sometimes combined in one process. In a brown\\nstew, the meat is first cooked in a pan with a little fat to\\nbrown it, and to sear the outside for retaining the juices,\\nbefore the actual stewing begins. A “pot-roast,” is an\\nold-fashioned method of cooking a solid piece of meat with a\\nlittle water in a pot on top of the stove. The water simmers\\nout, and the meat is browned. What methods does this process\\nunite?\\nThe American Indians in their Squantum, or Clam Bake, heated a\\nlayer of stones by means of a fire on top, removing the ashes\\nwhen the fire died down. A layer of wet seaweed was placed on\\nthe stones, and upon this clams, fish, and corn were laid, and\\ncovered with another layer of seaweed.

       " '70\\nCHAPTER V\\nWATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES\\nAlthough water does not supply energy to the body, it plays an important\\npart in nutrition. As building material, it constitutes about two thirds\\nof the body weight, and as a regulator of body processes it serves as a\\nsolvent and carrier of nutritive material and waste, keeps the blood and\\ndigestive fluids of proper concentration, and helps to regulate the\\ntemperature of the body. It is contained in nearly all food materials and\\nis the basis of all beverages.\\nWater as a beverage.—Water is being given off all the time from the body\\nthrough the lungs, skin, and kidneys. The exact amount depends partly upon\\natmospheric conditions and the amount of exercise, which affect the loss\\nthrough the lungs and skin, and partly on the amount taken in, for water\\npasses through the body rather quickly. We can endure lack of food for\\nweeks, but can exist only a few days without water.\\nA drink of water taken the first thing in the morning tends to clean out\\nthe digestive tract and put one in good condition for breakfast. Water\\nwith meals aids digestion, provided it is not used to wash down food but\\nis taken when the mouth is empty. It should not be extremely cold nor hot.\\nTwo glasses at a single meal are usually all that are desirable. When\\nthere is much water in the food, as in soups, milk, fruits, and some\\nvegetables, or when other beverages are taken, less will be taken as plain\\nwater. When one\\nfeels71\\nhungry and uncomfortable between meals a drink of\\nwater will often relieve the sensation.\\nWater is either soft or hard. Rain water is perfectly soft, but as it\\npasses through the earth after falling, it sometimes becomes laden with\\nmineral substances, that affect its cleansing properties, and that may\\naffect its physiological action. Such water is called hard.\\nTemporary hardness is caused by a soluble lime compound which is\\nprecipitated by boiling. If the teakettle is incrusted inside by a layer\\nof lime, the hardness is of this character. Such water should be boiled\\nand cooled for drinking. Permanent hardness is due to other compounds of\\nlime and magnesia which are not precipitated by boiling, but which can be\\ncounteracted for cleansing purposes by the addition of some substance like\\nammonia, borax, or soda. If the excess of salts has some undesirable\\nphysiological effect, this water should be distilled, or bottled water for\\ndrinking brought from elsewhere.\\nOf much greater importance is the question of the freedom of the water\\nsupply from harmful bacteria and organic matter. Never use a well without\\nhaving the water tested by an expert. This will sometimes be done by the\\nlocal or state Board of Health or Experiment Station. All water sources\\nshould be guarded from contamination. (See “Shelter and Clothing,” Chapter\\nV.) Filters may be used, and are effective in straining out sediment, but\\nthe home filter is seldom to be relied upon to remove actual bacterial\\ncontamination. If used at all, the filter should be frequently cleaned and\\nsterilized in boiling water. In case the supply is suspected, the water\\nfor drinking should be boiled for at least ten minutes, allowed to settle,\\nif necessary, and poured off into bottles for cooling. This is a practice\\nto be commended after a heavy rainfall, and especially in the autumn.\\nThese bottles may be placed on the ice.',\n",
       " '72\\nIce must be used with caution always in drinking water, and it is the\\nsafer way to cool the water beside the ice. The freezing of water in pond\\nand river does not purify or sterilize it. Natural ice is usually\\nquestionable. Artificial ice, if properly manufactured, is much safer.\\nAlways have a supply of water in covered pitcher or water bottle, with\\nclean glasses at hand, where it may be taken freely when wanted. Remember\\nthat the individual cup or glass is an absolute necessity. The dipper or\\nglass in common must not be countenanced. In a large family of many\\nchildren it would save labor to use paper cups between meals.\\nWater should be swallowed slowly, and ice-cold water should not be taken\\nwhen one is overheated. When one is overthirsty, control must be exercised\\nin regard to quantity and rapidity of drinking.\\nWater in cooking.—Water is necessary to the softening of fiber, and the\\ncooking of starch. It acts as a solvent for sugar and salt and for\\ngelatin, and is the basis of meat soups, certain substances in the meat\\ndissolving in the water. The flavors of tea and coffee are extracted by\\nwater.\\nAs a medium in cooking it supplies heat in the steaming, boiling, and\\nstewing processes, and in the form of melting ice with salt it acts as a\\nfreezing medium.\\nIt is not necessary to lift the cover of a kettle to see if the water\\nboils, if one is familiar with the action of water nearing and at the\\nboiling point. A simple experiment with the boiling of water in a Florence\\nflask is always interesting, and from it one gains practical knowledge.',\n",
       " 'Experiments with the boiling temperature of water.\\nA. Apparatus: A ring stand, a Florence flask, a square of\\nwire net, a chemical thermometer, a Bunsen burner.\\nMethod: Place the Florence flask, half full of water, on the\\nsquare of wire net upon the large ring of the ring\\nstand73\\nover\\nthe Bunsen burner. Put the chemical thermometer in the Florence\\nflask, clamping it in such a way that the bulb is covered by the\\nwater and yet does not touch the bottom of the flask.\\nMake record in the notebook as follows:\\n(1) The temperature when the first small bubbles appear on the\\nside of the flask.\\n(2) Temperature when the first large bubbles appear on the\\nbottom.\\n(3) Temperature when many bubbles rise rapidly to the top.\\n(4) Point at which temperature ceases to rise.\\n(5) Temperature when vapor first appears at the mouth of the\\nflask.\\n(6) What differences are apparent in the amount and motion of\\nthe vapor before and after boiling?\\n(7) Lift the thermometer above the water and note the\\ntemperature just above the surface, when the water is rapidly\\nboiling.\\nThe small bubbles are bubbles of air. The large are bubbles of\\nsteam. A complete study of the boiling process should be made in\\nthe Physics class. The boiling point is the point at which water\\nbecomes steam, and also the point at which steam condenses again\\nto water. The temperature of boiling water and steam are the\\nsame. Under pressure steam may be heated to a higher\\ntemperature.\\nB. Boil water in a small saucepan closely covered.\\n(1) Note the sounds of the water just before boiling, and the\\nchange in sound as the boiling begins.\\n(2) Note the difference between the vapor escaping, before\\nboiling, and after. This experiment is best performed in a\\nteakettle.\\nC. Test the temperature of the inner part of the double\\nboiler, when the water boils rapidly below. To be exact, a hole\\nshould be bored in the cover of the boiler, a cork with a hole\\ninserted, the thermometer run through the cork. An approximate\\nresult is obtained by putting in the thermometer, setting on the\\ncover tilted, and covering the opening with a cloth.\\nD. Stir salt into rapidly boiling water in the lower part of\\nthe74\\ndouble boiler until no more salt will dissolve (a saturated\\nsolution). Test the temperature.\\nE. Put the inner part of the double boiler containing water\\ninto this boiling solution of saturated salt, being sure that\\nthe inner part is sufficiently deep in the salt solution. Note\\nthe temperature of the water in the inner boiler when it becomes\\nheated.\\nBoiling at high altitudes.—When the air pressure upon the surface of the\\nwater is lessened, the water boils at a lower temperature. As the altitude\\nincreases, the air pressure decreases, as many a mountain traveler knows\\nto his cost. The boiling temperature of water is so much lowered that the\\ndwellers in high regions of several thousand feet find it difficult to\\ncook starchy vegetables well. A heavy iron pot is made with clamps for\\nfastening down a tight cover, which increases the temperature somewhat.\\nExperiments D and E indicate a method that can be used to a small\\nextent. The baking process should be largely used, and boiling avoided.\\nFor meat, eggs, and fish the lower temperature is not undesirable. (See\\nthe chapters relating to these foods.)\\nThe uses of ice.—Water freezes and ice melts at the same point, 32° F.,\\nor 0° C. If ice is mixed with salt, the temperature is reduced far below\\nthe freezing point, nearly to 0° F. This process reduces any watery\\nsubstance which it surrounds to its freezing point, the heat being used in\\nthe melting of the ice. This is an interesting topic to discuss in the\\nPhysics class.\\nIce at its ordinary temperature of 32° F. is used for cooling food\\nagreeably. Its most important function in the refrigerator is as preserver\\nof food for a short time at least. For this it is invaluable, and cheap\\nice is really necessary in summer to the health of a great city.\\nIce substitutes.—Where the supply fails or the price is exorbitant, one\\nproperty of water makes it a partial\\naid.75\\nThe rapid evaporation of water\\nwill absorb heat so rapidly as to reduce the temperature of adjacent\\nbodies. In the tropics when ice is lacking, water is hung in porous jars\\nin the breeze, and the temperature of the water in the jar is reduced.\\nTo keep milk and butter cool wrap a wet cloth about the containing jar,\\nand set the jar upon the window sill, keeping one end of the towel in a\\nvessel of water; or the cloth may be wrapped directly around the butter.\\nThis method is surprisingly effective.\\nFruit beverages.—Fruit juices with water and sugar make refreshing\\nbeverages and have nutritive value as well. (See the next chapter.)\\nCocoa and chocolate, coffee, and tea.—These are the three most important\\nnon-alcoholic beverages used by man. They are used because of the\\nagreeable flavor given them by volatile oils, and also because they have a\\nstimulating effect. The stimulating property is due to an alkaloid, a\\ncrystallizable substance known in cocoa as theobromine, in coffee as\\ncaffeine, and in tea as theine. Chemical investigation indicates that\\ncaffeine and theine are the same and theobromine is a closely related\\nsubstance. These substances have a recognized stimulating effect upon the\\nnervous system, and the beverages containing them should therefore be used\\nwith caution by all. In the opinion of the writers, tea and coffee should\\nnot be taken by young people under twenty-five years of age. Tea and\\ncoffee also contain tannin, an astringent substance giving a disagreeable\\nflavor to coffee and tea when these are improperly made, and having an\\nundesirable effect upon digestion. Chocolate contains a non-volatile fat\\n(cocoa butter) in large amount, and should be classed as a food as well as\\na beverage.\\nThe plants from which cocoa, coffee, and tea are derived are natives of\\nsemi-tropical or tropical Africa, Asia,\\nand76\\nAmerica, having been\\nintroduced to Europe by early travelers in these lands.',\n",
       " 'The introduction of these beverages is an interesting bit of\\nhistory. The Spaniards found cocoa in tropical America, and\\ncarried it back to Spain, and it was not used in England until\\n1657. It was sold in Danvers, Massachusetts, in 1771, the raw\\nmaterial having been brought by Gloucester fishermen from the\\nWest Indies. Coffee is said to have originated in Abyssinia,\\nreaching Europe by way of Arabia, and being sold in England in\\n1650. Coffee-houses were licensed in America in 1715. A Chinese\\ntradition places the discovery of the use of tea at 2700 B.C. It\\nwas first used in England in 1657, and was imported into America\\nin 1711. An amusing story is told of the first tea party in a\\ntown of western Connecticut, where the tea was boiled violently\\nin a large iron kettle and served on a platter with the leaves,\\nas a form of soup, the leaves themselves being eaten.\\nCocoa and chocolate.—Cocoa and chocolate are manufactured from the seed\\nof a tree, Theobroma cacao, grown in tropical America. The seeds, when\\nremoved from the containing pod, are fermented to improve the flavor,\\ndried, cleaned, roasted, and finally ground. The outer husk is loosened in\\nthe roasting, and is then removed, and sold as “cocoa shells.” It is the\\nbasis of a cheap beverage with an agreeable flavor. The first crushing of\\nthe seeds gives cocoa “nibs,” and these are further ground in a mill, and\\nfinally molded into the cake of plain chocolate. The addition of sugar,\\nvanilla, cinnamon, and sometimes other spices gives a variety of sweet\\nchocolates. Powdered cocoa is prepared by the removal of the fat, which is\\na valuable product in itself, sugar and flavorings are added and sometimes\\na starch. The Dutch manufacturers use alkalies for removing the crude\\nfiber and improving the color, and the consequent loss of flavor is\\nbalanced by the use of other flavoring matter. The adulterations of cocoa\\nare\\nlargely77\\nstarch in excess. The French and American cocoas are flavored\\nwith vanilla, the Dutch manufacturers using cinnamon as well.\\nThe so-called soluble cocoas are very finely ground, and therefore mix\\nreadily with water, remaining in suspension for some time, but the cocoa\\nitself is not dissolved. Powdered cocoa is bought in tin cans, is cheap,\\nand is even more economical if bought in large cans than in small.\\nChocolate is more expensive always than the cocoa, and may be bought in\\ncakes in pound packages, or in powdered form for immediate use.\\nCoffee is the inner seed of a berry from a tree, Coffea arabica, the\\nprocess of manufacture consisting of the removal of the outer pulp,\\nfermentation, washing, drying, and roasting. The first stages of the\\nprocess are carried on at the coffee plantation, the raw berries being\\nimported, and roasted shortly before using. The roasting in cocoa, coffee,\\nand tea is necessary for desirable flavors, the heat developing volatile,\\naromatic principles, caramelizing the sugar, and causing other chemical\\nchanges. The differences in the flavor of coffees are due to the variety,\\nthe soil and climate, and methods of production and manufacture. No coffee\\ngrown in the western hemisphere has excelled, and scarcely has any\\nequaled, the original Mocha and Java coffees, and these have long been\\ntrade names for coffee from other places, because of the popular liking\\nfor these brands. Brazil is now the great coffee producing country of the\\nworld, and from South and Central America and the West Indies we obtain\\ncoffee of excellent flavor.\\nThe adulterations of coffee should be noted, although these are of the\\nkind that gives the buyer something cheaper in place of coffee, rather\\nthan a substance that is injurious. Ground chicory root is sometimes mixed\\nwith coffee,\\nbut78\\ncannot be classed strictly as an adulterant, because\\nmany people, notably the French, add it openly, preferring its flavor.\\nAmong adulterants are rye meal, bran, beans and peas, cocoa shells, and\\neven sawdust. Artificial beans have been made of bran, molasses, and\\nwater, sometimes with the addition of chicory and coloring matter. If\\nground coffee is put into a glass of cold water, it floats on the top and\\nremains hard, while several of the adulterants named soften and sink to\\nthe bottom of the glass. Highly roasted coffee, however, will sometimes\\nsink. Coffee beans from which coffee extract has been made are sometimes\\nmixed with other coffee.\\nCoffee extracts and crystallized coffee are manufactured to simplify the\\ncoffee-making process, but the flavor is not equal to that of coffee\\ninfusion made directly from the bean. A preparation of coffee is also\\noffered with the caffeine removed by some chemical process, but it is\\nexpensive in this country.\\nBuy coffee in the bean, and see that it is freshly roasted. Coffee, whole\\nor ground, is sold extensively by the pound in tin cans, with a fancy\\nlabel and name, and in this form it is usually expensive. Good coffee may\\nbe bought for twenty-five cents a pound of many reliable dealers, and may\\nbe purchased in five or ten pound packages, or bought in bulk to be kept\\nin a tightly closed can.\\nTea is the dried leaf of a shrub, Camellia thea, growing in the\\ncomparatively high lands of Japan, China, India, and Ceylon. A tea\\nplantation exists in South Carolina, U.S.A., and furnishes a very pleasing\\ngrade of tea, somewhat resembling Japan tea in flavor. We are familiar\\nwith the fact that there are many kinds and grades of tea, the tea shrub\\nvarying as does the coffee tree, and the methods of curing affecting both\\ncolor and flavor. The teas from the countries named have characteristic\\nflavors, and\\neach79\\ncountry has different varieties and grades. Russian tea\\nis not grown in Russia, but is Chinese tea carried across the continent of\\nAsia.\\nIn general, tea may be classed as green or black, this difference in color\\ndepending upon the age of the leaf, and largely upon differences in the\\ncuring process. Green tea is made from the young leaf, and after picking\\nis dried immediately by artificial heat, being constantly stirred for\\nabout an hour, in which time the leaves twist and curl. For black tea the\\nleaves are allowed to wilt and ferment, before they are rolled and heated;\\nand sometimes the heating is repeated. These details of the process vary\\nin different localities. The leaves are finally sorted and graded for\\npacking.\\nBoth black and green teas are made in China. “Bohea” is one of the famous\\nblack Chinese teas. “English Breakfast Tea” is known as such only in\\nAmerica, and is a blend of black teas. Black tea is not so successfully\\nmade in Japan as in China. “Oolong,” from the island of Formosa, has the\\nappearance of a black tea, with the flavor of a green. In Japan and China\\nold-time methods prevail, with much handling of the tea leaves, but in\\nCeylon and India modern machinery makes the process a much more cleanly\\none.\\nAnother classification of tea is that depending upon the age and size of\\nthe leaf, the young leaf making the finer grade tea. For example, in the\\nblack teas of India “flowery pekoe” is made from the youngest leaf,\\n“orange pekoe” from the second, “pekoe” from the third, and “souchong” and\\n“congou” come from the larger leaves.\\nThe adulterations of tea are usually the leaves of other plants, but as a\\nmatter of fact very little adulterated tea is imported. The first grades\\nof teas, however, and those most highly prized by the Chinese and\\nJapanese, seldom find their way to America.',\n",
       " '80\\nOther beverages.—Several very acceptable coffee substitutes are on the\\nmarket, made from roasted and ground grain, and they give an agreeable hot\\ndrink for breakfast when served with cream or milk. In some cases they\\nseem to have a laxative effect, which is well for some people and not for\\nothers. A pleasant hot drink of the same nature may be made from the\\nbrowned crusts of bread.\\nThe substitutes for tea are not usually satisfactory. The Indians of the\\nwestern coast of the United States make a tea from a plant which they call\\n“Buona Yerba,” but for us it has a strong resemblance to the medicinal\\nherb teas formerly used for curative purposes, such as sage, catnip,\\nmotherwort, and the like.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " '1. Lemonade and fruit drinks.\\nUtensils.—Silver knife for paring and slicing, glass lemon\\nsqueezer, a grater, a strainer, and a saucepan. Avoid the use of\\ntin and iron utensils.\\nMaterials.—Lemon or other fruits, sugar water.\\nProportions.—One half lemon to a glass, or 2 or 3 to a quart\\nof water. Other fruits “according to taste.” Experiment here,\\nusing the juice and pulp of any fruit, combining those that are\\nvery acid with those that lack acidity,—lemon and raspberry,\\nfor example. One third to 1⁄2 cup sugar to a quart. The\\nproportion cannot be stated with exactness, for fruit varies in\\nacidity, and the final result must always be tested by the\\ntaste.\\nMethod.\\nPlain lemonade.—After deciding upon the proper amounts to be\\nused, dissolve the sugar in a part of the water, brought to the\\nboiling point. When cool, add the lemon juice and remaining\\nwater, ice and serve. A small portion of grated rind may be\\nadded to the boiling water.\\nAnother method is to use lump sugar, rubbing the peel of the\\nlemon upon each lump before dissolving.\\nThe general method is the same with other fruits, pulpy fruit\\nand berries being mashed, the water added, and strained.',\n",
       " '81\\nCherries, strawberries, and pieces of pulp are sometimes\\nadded before serving, when the fruit drink is ladled from a bowl\\nas fruit punch. Be sure to cut the berries if they are large. A\\nbrightness is imparted to the fruit punch by the addition of\\ncarbonated water just before serving. A quart of fruit punch, if\\nserved in small cups, will suffice for eight people.\\n2. Cocoa shells.\\nPrinciple.—To extract the flavor from the shells, by boiling\\nin water.\\nUtensil.—A saucepan or coffee boiler.\\nProportions.—One half cup shells to 1 quart boiling water. As\\nmuch as 1 cup of the shells may be used.\\nMethod.\\nWash the shells in a strainer under the faucet. Put the shells\\nin the pot, pour on boiling water, and simmer gently for 1⁄2\\nhour. Strain off, and serve with cream, or milk, or evaporated\\nmilk and sugar.\\n3. Cocoa.\\nPrinciple.—To mix the particles smoothly and evenly with the\\nliquid by stirring and by heating.\\nUtensils.—A measuring cup, a saucepan, spoon, and beater. A\\ndouble boiler, if milk only is used.\\nIngredients.—Powdered cocoa, sugar, water, or milk, or milk\\nand water. Cocoa made with milk does not agree with some people,\\nin which case it may be made with water only, and served with\\ncream, milk, or evaporated milk.\\nProportions.—One teaspoonful of cocoa to 1⁄2 measuring cup.\\nMore or less as preferred. One teaspoonful of sugar, ditto.\\nMethod.\\nHeat the liquid. Stir a portion of the liquid cold, with the\\ncocoa, add this to the hot liquid, add the sugar, and beat\\nvigorously for a minute before removing from the fire.\\n4. Chocolate.\\nPrinciple.—To mix the chocolate smoothly with the liquid that\\nthe fat may not float on the top. This is accomplished by having\\nall the ingredients either hot or cold. If after the chocolate\\nis dissolved in a hot liquid, cold liquid is added, the oil\\nseparates and floats.',\n",
       " '82\\nUtensils.—A grater, or sharp knife, a saucepan, mixing spoon,\\nand beater.\\nA French chocolate maker claims that any metal utensil affects\\nthe flavor of the chocolate, and always uses an earthen pot and\\nwooden spoon and heater. An earthenware chocolate pot for this\\npurpose is on the market.\\nIngredients.—Chocolate, sugar, milk, or milk and water.\\nProportions.—The amount of chocolate may be varied, depending\\nupon the richness desired. Three or 4 ounce squares to 1 quart\\nliquid, 4 teaspoonfuls sugar to 1 quart. The liquid is better\\nhalf milk and half water, rather than milk only.\\nMethod\\n1.[10]\\nThe cold method.\\nPut the liquid and sugar into the saucepan. Break or cut the\\nchocolate into small pieces, add to the liquid, and heat the\\nliquid slowly, stirring occasionally but not constantly. When\\nthe liquid is hot, just before it reaches the boiling point,\\nbeat vigorously with a wooden spoon, or beater. The Dover beater\\nis convenient. This beating makes a velvety smooth and a foamy\\nmixture.\\nMethod 2.\\nThe hot method.\\nHeat the liquid with the sugar. Grate the chocolate or shave it\\nwith a knife. Protect the chocolate from the warmth of the\\nfingers by a piece of paper. The process is less “sticky” if the\\nchocolate and grater are chilled in the refrigerator. Just as\\nthe liquid is reaching the boiling point, pour in the grated\\nchocolate, and beat vigorously.\\nBeaten chocolate does not need any additional cream when served.\\nBeaten whipped cream is attractive on the top of each cup. But\\nremember that chocolate is already rich in fat, and that\\nadditional fat may be indigestible. Such a cup of chocolate\\ntaken for luncheon with a roll is sufficient for the meal, and\\nis certainly too rich in fat for serving at an afternoon tea.\\n5. Coffee.\\nPrinciple.—To extract the flavoring oils at the boiling point\\nof water, and to avoid the extraction of the tannin.\\nThe83\\ntannin\\nis extracted by prolonged boiling, and when the liquid coffee\\nstands upon the grounds.\\nUtensils.—Coffee grinder, measuring cup, pot. The kind of pot\\ndepends upon the method used. One house furnishing firm displays\\nsome seventy different coffee pots, but they may be divided into\\nthree classes, the pot for boiling, the drip coffee pot, and\\nthe percolator (see Figs. 23 and 24). The coffee boiler should\\nhave a lip, and not a spout. A word of warning is needed in\\nregard to the care of the pot. Coffee grounds should be removed\\nfrom any pot immediately, and the pot washed at once in scalding\\nhot soapsuds, rinsed, dried, and aired. Let the pot stand with\\ncover off. If this is not done, a coat is soon formed on the\\ninside of the pot, which spoils the flavor of the coffee. Where\\nthe pot has been neglected, boiling it out with a solution of\\ncaustic soda is sometimes a remedy.',\n",

       " 'Ingredients.—Ground coffee, water, cold or boiling, white of\\negg or egg shell for boiled coffee. The coffee should be ground\\nto medium fineness for boiled coffee, to a finer powder for the\\npercolated and drip coffee.\\nProportions.—One part of coffee to 5 or 6 of water, depending\\nupon the strength desired. One egg shell, or half the white of\\nan egg to 1 cup of ground coffee.',\n",
       " '84\\nMethod 1.\\nBoiling.—Measure the coffee and water. Stir the white or the\\nshell of an egg with the coffee, adding a little of the water,\\nput this into the pot, add the remaining water cold, stir\\nthoroughly, allow the water to rise slowly to the boiling point,\\nand to boil one minute, remove the pot from the fire, pour in a\\nsmall amount of cold water, and let the coffee stand for five\\nminutes or until the grounds settle. During the cooking close\\nthe lip with clean soft paper if it has no lid. The actual\\nboiling is continued for a brief period only, and coffee made by\\nthis method is considered by some people to have a flavor\\nlacking in drip or percolator coffee. The egg is added to\\nclarify the coffee. Pour off the liquid coffee from the grounds,\\nand keep hot until it is time to serve it.\\nA second method differs from this in that the water is poured on\\nat the boiling temperature, allowed to reach the boiling point\\nin two or three minutes, and boiled for five minutes. The first\\ngives uniformly better results. It is true, however, that\\ndifferent kinds of coffee need different treatment, and there is\\nroom here for much experimenting.\\nMethod 2.\\nDrip coffee.—In this method the coffee is put in a receptacle\\nabove, the water passes slowly through, collecting in the pot\\nbelow, from which it is served. Stand the lower part of the pot\\nin a pan of hot water, or where it will keep hot. Measure the\\nwater, and bring it to the boiling point. Heat the ground coffee\\nslightly, put it in the upper section of the pot, and pour on\\nthe water very slowly. Of course, the water is not actually\\nboiling when it touches the coffee. If the liquid coffee is not\\nstrong enough, pour it from the lower part and pass it through\\nthe grounds again. This is the French method, and is an\\nexcellent way to prepare after-dinner coffee.\\nMethod 3.\\nPercolator coffee.—In the percolator the water boils within the\\npot, and passes through the coffee at the boiling temperature.\\nThe exact method depends upon the pattern of the pot, and\\ndirections always accompany a given pot. For those who can use\\nelectricity, the electric percolator certainly gives an\\nexcellent coffee.',\n",
       " '85\\nCoffee is served “black,” or with cream, milk, or evaporated\\nmilk and sugar. If milk is used for breakfast coffee, serve it\\nhot.\\n6. Tea.\\nPrinciple.—To extract flavor by allowing the leaves to remain\\nfor a few minutes, in water which has been poured on at the\\nboiling temperature, and to avoid the extraction of tannin by\\nmaking the period of steeping short. Tea must never be boiled.\\nUtensils.—An earthen pot, measuring cup, teaspoon, strainer.\\nSometimes a tea ball or piece of cheesecloth.\\nProportion.—One teaspoonful of tea to about 1 cup of water,\\nthe amount depending upon the kind of tea.\\nMethod.—Measure the water and bring it to the boiling point.\\nHeat the tea slightly in the pot, pour on the water rapidly,\\nallow to stand three to five minutes, strain into a heated pot\\nfor serving. The length of the steeping depends also upon the\\nkind of tea. If there is an astringent flavor, the tea has stood\\ntoo long.\\nThe following method was recommended by an expert in India teas.\\nBring the water to a boil in a saucepan, throw in the tea\\nleaves, lift the saucepan instantly to stop the boiling, steep\\nfor 3 or 4 minutes, strain off and keep hot. This expert claimed\\nthat by actually having the tea leaves at the boiling\\ntemperature for an instant the flavor is improved. Serve with\\ncream or milk, or sliced lemon and sugar.\\nWhere tea is to be served in very large quantities, this last\\nmethod is very convenient. The water can be brought to the boil\\nin a large kettle, and the tea thrown in, but care must be\\nexercised to see that the steeping does not last too long. The\\ntea, once decanted, can be kept hot for several hours, without\\nlosing flavor. Or again, a small amount of extra strong tea may\\nbe prepared, to be diluted with boiling water as it is served.\\nThe tea ball, or the plan of tying the tea in small pieces of\\ncheesecloth, is convenient for serving at an afternoon tea.\\n7. Iced cocoa, coffee, and tea.\\nCocoa and coffee are agreeable in hot weather served in a glass\\nwith ice, and cream and powdered sugar. Make\\nboth86\\nslightly\\nstronger than for hot drinks, as the ice in melting dilutes the\\nliquid.\\nIced tea.—Prepare a small amount of strong tea, using 4\\nteaspoonfuls to 1 cup boiling water, strain off and cool. Dilute\\nwith iced water to the proper strength, sweeten with powdered\\nsugar, and serve in glasses with one or two slices of lemon to\\neach glass. For those who do not like the lemon, iced tea may be\\nserved with cream.\\nEXERCISES\\n1. What are the functions of water in the body?\\n2.

Now that we\\ncount Porto Rico among our possessions, a list of our fruits would include\\nmost of the varieties known in the temperate and semi-tropical zones. The\\nUnited States Department of Agriculture experiments with new varieties\\nfrom foreign lands that may make themselves at home in our soil, and work\\nlike that of Luther Burbank produces new species. Scientific methods of\\nfruit growing are becoming more common, and the quality of fruit will\\ndoubtless improve in spite of fungous diseases and injurious insects. Our\\nwild fruits are not yet entirely rooted out. The Maine blueberry, for\\nexample, is found on hundreds of acres and needs no cultivation beyond\\nburning over every third year.\\nFruit is necessary in our diet, and is not an extravagance unless we buy\\nfancy varieties brought from a distance, or native fruits out of season.\\nComposition and nutritive value.—The chief foodstuffs in fruits are\\ncarbohydrates and mineral matter. Fresh fruit contains from 75 to 95 per\\ncent of water, and its presence is apparent in such juicy fruits as the\\nmelon and the orange. Figure 25 shows that seemingly dry fruits like the\\nbanana and the apple also contain much water. Even fruits which have been\\nartificially dried, like prunes and raisins,\\ncontain90\\nsome water. (Fig.\\n26.) Although the carbohydrates of fruits are largely in the form of\\nsugars easily digested and valuable as fuel, this kind of food is\\nespecially valuable for its rich supply of ash, including the compounds of\\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. The iron is of great\\nimportance, being in a form much more useful to the normal processes of\\nthe body than that prescribed medicinally. The bulk given by cellulose,\\nand the laxative property of fruit acids also are safeguards against\\nconstipation, especially in a meat diet. Fruit is the best possible\\ndessert after a hearty meat dinner.',\n",

Fruit juice\\ncan91\\nbe taken by little children and invalids who\\nmight find the fiber troublesome. Some people cannot eat berries on\\naccount of irritation caused by the seeds. In this case, juice may be\\nsqueezed from cooked berries and used for beverages and jelly.\\nHow to buy.—Since we should eat fruit daily, and not merely as a “treat,”\\nit is important to practice economy in buying it. Fresh fruits in season,\\nand dried fruits are the cheapest. Canned fruit is economical when it is a\\nproduct of one’s own garden, or put up when some fruit has a low market\\nprice. Prices are so variable, even with one variety, that no definite sum\\ncan be given as a fixed price. Apples vary from fifty cents a bushel near\\nthe orchard and in season, to ten cents apiece for a fancy table variety\\nin the winter. When you buy fresh fruit, inquire the prices of the many\\nkinds offered, note which is cheapest, and then observe whether the\\ncheaper kind is such because it is abundant, or because it is of inferior\\nquality. If you chance to want apples for cooking, and the only cheap\\napples are spotted and bruised, then buy dried apples, or even canned. It\\nis best to decide upon the fruit after you have studied market conditions\\nrather than before.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",

If you are\\nvery fond of sugar, your taste may not be the safest guide.\\nPractical home work.—If you can secure a very slow oven, say\\na coal oven at night, or a gas oven with a low flame, make an\\napple sauce in an earthenware pot, as heavy as a bean pot,\\nclosely covered, leaving the pot in the oven from six to eight\\nhours. This process is satisfactory in a fireless cooker where a\\nhot stone or iron is used. Remember that water keeps down\\ntemperature, and also that it evaporates steadily even in a slow\\noven. How much water will you put over the apples when the\\nprocess begins?\\nIf you have never cooked apples in this way you will be\\nsurprised at the color and flavor.',\n",

If you compare\\nthe raisins with the grapes in Fig. 26, you will see how much\\nwater is lost in the drying process. The same difference would\\nbe evident if you had pictures of a fresh plum and a prune, side\\nby side. This water must be supplied in the process of\\npreparation. The best way to accomplish this is by soaking the\\nprunes many hours, say over night. Prunes have a most undeserved\\nreputation, because they are not well cooked, and at some tables\\nare served too often.\\nWith this one new step introduced you may plan the cooking of\\nthe prunes, from what you know of apple sauce.

       " '96\\nOther dried fruits may be treated in the same way.\\nApricots and peaches yield delightful flavors when carefully\\nprepared; and dried apples are also excellent.\\nPreservation of Fruit and Other Foods\\nThe preservation of fruit and other foods has been a household industry\\nfor generations, and it is now an important commercial industry. The\\nold-time farm had its smokehouse where hams and beef were “cured,” the\\nbarrel of brine stood in the cellar for pork and corned beef, apples and\\ncorn were dried for winter use, and rows of preserve jars stood upon the\\nshelves. Food was preserved by simple processes long before the reason for\\nthe decay and spoiling of food was fully understood, but with larger\\nknowledge and better appliances, we now preserve food more effectively and\\nin quantities larger than were possible in former days.\\nFruit is the food material now most commonly preserved in the home\\nkitchen. Vegetables need to be subjected to heat for a much longer time\\nthan fruit, and many people prefer to buy canned vegetables rather than to\\ngo to the trouble and expense of canning them at home. Where there is an\\noversupply of vegetables in the home garden, it is sometimes economy to\\ncan them, and this may be done if care is exercised. The cost of fuel and\\nlabor must be counted in, when studying the question of home preserving\\nversus buying the canned product.\\nWhatever the food material, and the process, the principles of\\npreservation are the same for all.\\nWhy does food spoil?—The decay and moldiness of fresh fruit are matters\\nof common observation; and the housekeeper knows that mold is liable to\\ncover the top of a jelly glass, and that a can of fruit will ferment at\\ntimes, even to the point of bursting the can.',\n",
       " '97\\nWe recognize another kind of deterioration in meat and fish that have\\nbecome tainted, even when no mold is visible, and there is no opportunity\\nfor ordinary fermentation. The microscope has given us eyes to see, and as\\na result of the patient work of the scientist with this instrument we now\\nknow that the difficulties in keeping food are caused by the presence of\\nminute vegetable organisms known as molds, yeasts, and bacteria. It is\\nimpossible in some cases to draw a sharp line between these different\\nforms of lower life, yet we are able to distinguish them sufficiently for\\npractical purposes.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 28.—Three species of mold. Buchanan’s\\nHousehold Bacteriology.',\n",
       " 'Masses of mold that can be seen with the naked eye are distinguished by\\na feathery appearance and bright color. Figure 28 shows three species of\\nthe green mold that affects jam and jellies. Other species are found in\\nRoquefort and Camembert cheese, and give the flavors characteristic in\\nthese cheeses.\\nThe presence of yeast can be detected by its action, but it cannot\\nitself be seen without the microscope. When canned fruit or homemade fruit\\njuice “works,” yeasts cells\\nare98\\npresent in great number. Figure 29 shows\\none form of yeast, highly magnified, and Fig. 30 shows a single yeast\\ncell. The yeast cake is a mixture of thousands of such cells with some\\nflour or flour and meal, and the cells lie dormant in the cake, until we\\nare ready to use them in bread. (See Chapter XII.) The actual yeast,\\nhowever, is what Fig. 30 shows it to be, a tiny, one-celled plant,\\nincreasing in number by the division of the single cell, or by the budding\\nout of one cell from another. When conditions are favorable the yeast\\ncells increase in number with great rapidity, and some of the sugar that\\nis present is broken down into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. It is this\\ngas that causes the familiar bubbling when fermentation is taking place.\\nWe put yeast cells into bread and cultivate it for this gas. But how does\\nit occur in canned fruits, when its presence is not desired? Wild yeast\\nfloats in the air, and lies upon the surface of fruit. All cultivated\\nyeast has been derived from wild yeast. In old-fashioned ways of\\nbread-making no yeast was\\nintroduced,99\\na soft dough being left in a warm\\nplace to ferment naturally, the yeast cells probably being present in the\\nflour. The yeast that spoils the canned fruit is present in the fruit, in\\nthe utensils, or can, and has not been killed as it should be in the\\ncanning process.',\n",

       " 'The bacteria are also one-celled microörganisms, smaller than the yeast.\\nFigure 31 shows the four types of bacterial cells. Their size is measured\\nby the unit used in the microscope, called the micron, which is about\\n1⁄25000 of one inch. Bacteria may measure from one to three or four of\\nthese microns in length. Some bacteria are reproduced by means of spores\\nwhich form within the cell. Bacteria, as they develop in some material,\\nproduce substances from the material that may or may not be injurious to\\nus. One important truth about the bacteria is this: that many of them are\\nharmless, and may even be made useful, as in the manufacture of fruit\\nvinegar. The pleasant acid of buttermilk and of sour milk is due also to\\nbacteria which are not harmful to us. However, there may be disease\\nproducing bacteria present in milk that is not clean, and their presence\\nmust not be tolerated. Other bacteria,\\ndeveloping100\\nin meat and fish,\\nproduce substances known as ptomaines, which are dangerous poisons; or,\\nmore often, the kinds of bacteria which thrive in meats and fish may\\nthemselves be directly injurious to man.\\nIt is evident, therefore, that the problem before us is the control of\\nthese lower organisms, that we may increase or destroy them as we will.\\nThe control of microörganisms.—With warmth, water, and food all living\\nthings flourish and grow; most organisms require air, but some of the\\nmicroörganisms do not. Where these conditions are best met, the organism\\nis most active and multiplies most rapidly. To retard growth or to destroy\\nlife, the conditions must be the reverse of favorable. While warmth, say a\\ntemperature from 70° to 90° F., promotes the life of most microörganisms,\\nintense heat destroys it. The boiling temperature, 212° F., will kill\\nthese lower organisms, although this heat has to be continued for some\\nlength of time, particularly in the case of spores. The spores of certain\\nbacteria are quite resistant. A temperature of 32° F. and lower retards\\ngrowth, but it requires extreme cold to destroy bacteria. Since moisture\\nis necessary to all the lower organisms, they do not develop in a dry\\nmaterial or dry place.\\nWe cannot destroy these lower forms of life by removing food from them,\\nsince they are ever present, but we can make the food unavailable to them\\nthrough the introduction in the material of certain substances called\\npreservatives which prevent their growth. The preservatives long familiar\\nare salt, sugar, wood-smoke, spices, vinegar, and alcohol. While a small\\namount of sugar is necessary in the fermentation process, a large amount\\nacts as a preservative, as in candied fruit. It is an interesting fact\\nthat alcohol and vinegar, products of fermentation processes, tend\\n(when101\\nsufficiently concentrated) to stop the growth of the fermentation\\norganisms.\\nTo the reader who desires a fuller account of the bacteria, yeast, and\\nmolds, especially as related to household affairs, Buchanan’s “Household\\nBacteriology” is recommended as the most recent and satisfactory book in\\nthis field.\\nA word about buying canned goods.—When canned goods are put up in large\\nquantities at the factory, abuses are likely to exist. Poor, even decayed,\\nfruit may be used, the whole process may be unclean from beginning to end,\\nand undesirable preservatives or an excess of sugar or spice may be\\nintroduced to cover the use of poor materials or methods. The condition of\\nthe worker in the cannery is one of the important industrial problems at\\nthe present time. Unhappily, poor conditions do often exist in canneries\\nthat turn out a cheap product. On the other hand, there are firms that may\\nwell take pride in their system from beginning to end.\\nServing canned food.—All canned food should be exposed to the air for a\\nshort time before serving, and stirred that the material may be aerated.\\nThis partially removes a certain flatness of taste. Canned fruit is\\nimproved by reheating, even.\\nWhen possible, vegetables bought in a tin can should be washed in the\\ncolander before they are heated. This greatly improves the flavor.',\n",

This\\nis a good method for berries, and for fruit that will be served\\nas a sauce. Proceed in the preparation and finishing according\\nto the general directions. Cook the fruit gently for half an\\nhour. Use as little water as possible. No sugar is required in\\nthe canning process, but the flavor is better if a small amount\\nis used in the beginning, a half cup of sugar to a pound of\\nfruit.\\nMethod 2.—Material cooked in the can. This is the better\\nmethod for whole fruit and halves. Select firm, well-shaped\\nfruit for this method, rejecting the mellow and soft fruit. Pack\\nthe cans tightly with the fruit, and pour in hot water with\\nsugar dissolved in it, a half cup to the quart can. More sugar\\ncan be used, if so desired. Set the jars in a boiler on a rack,\\nand surround them with warm water, to a height that will not\\nallow the water to boil into the cans.\\nSet the cover on each jar, but do not fasten them. Cover the\\nboiler closely, bring the water to a boil, and allow it to boil\\nfor an hour. At the end of this time, test the fruit for\\ntenderness with a fork, pour in more sirup if it is necessary.\\nRemove the jars when the water has cooled sufficiently, and\\nadjust the covers.\\nCold105\\nwater is sometimes used at the\\nbeginning, but this makes the process longer.\\nThis is a good method also for the canning of whole vegetables\\nlike peas and asparagus. The cooking of vegetables should\\ncontinue for at least two hours, and three hours are better for\\npeas and string beans.\\nApparatus is constructed for this method of canning, but the\\nordinary boiler answers the purpose.\\nPreserving.\\nA good method for peaches, apricots, and quinces. Select firm\\nand handsome fruit and prepare it carefully. Allow a pound of\\nsugar to a pound of fruit. (What is the measure of a pound of\\nsugar?) Place enough water in the kettle to cover the fruit,\\ndissolve the sugar in the water, put the fruit into the kettle,\\nand cook very gently until the fruit becomes a clear color.\\nRapid boiling spoils the shape of the fruit. Do not stir at all,\\nbut skim off any scum that rises to the top. When the fruit is\\ndone, put it with great care into the jars. If the sirup is\\nthin, boil it down for a short time, and then fill the jar.\\nClose the jar as in canning.\\nThis is a difficult process for beginners.\\nJam making, and fruit butter.\\nThis is the most economical of the preserving processes and the\\neasiest for the novice. It is nothing more than a fruit sauce,\\nwith a larger amount of sugar than usual to assist in its\\npreservation.\\nSoft and somewhat imperfect fruit may be used. If in the basket\\nof fruit bought for canning or preserving there are some fully\\nripe or poorly shaped specimens, these may be used for jam. For\\njam proper allow a pint of sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook the\\nfruit with enough water to prevent its sticking to the kettle,\\nusing as little as possible.\\nMash the fruit by stirring it occasionally as it cooks. When the\\nfruit is soft, add the sugar, stir thoroughly, and cook gently\\nfor about five minutes. Test by cooling a spoonful on a saucer.\\nThe jam should thicken slightly. When ready, pour it into jelly\\nglasses, or somewhat larger earthen jars—“jam pots.” Seal, as\\ndirected for jelly.\\nThe fruit butter is even more like fruit sauce than is the\\njam, for it is softer than jam, and contains less sugar. A cup\\nor only a\\nhalf106\\ncup of sugar to the pound of fruit is enough.\\nProceed exactly as in jam-making.\\nApple butter may be flavored with spices, with ginger root and\\nlemon juice, and with other fruits. One or two quinces or a\\nslice of pineapple cooked with the apples gives a pleasing\\nvariety. Exercise the inventive faculty here.\\nJelly making.\\nThere is another principle involved in jelly\\nmaking in addition to the principle of preservation. Fruit\\ncontains a substance known as pectose, one of the carbohydrates,\\nthat partially solidifies the fruit juice when the water in the\\njuice is partially evaporated. The addition of sugar helps in\\nthis process, but no amount of sugar will set the jelly if the\\npectose is not present. Some fruits have more than others, and\\nalso more when not over-ripe. Currants and firm apples are good\\njelly makers, and serve as a basis for other fruits that do not\\njelly well. Mellow summer apples do not set well. Crab apples\\nare excellent for this purpose.\\nThere is another step in this process, the straining out of the\\njuice from the pulp. For this, prepare a jelly bag from firm\\ncotton cloth which has been boiled and washed. This bag must be\\nhung in such a way that the juice drops from the point of the\\nbag into a bowl below. It may be hung upon a stick between two\\nchairs, or upon the rod of a strong towel rack over a table.\\n1. Apple jelly.\\nSelect tart, red-skinned apples, cut them in\\nsmall pieces with the skins on, retain the cores, and put them\\nin a kettle with cold water to barely cover. When thoroughly\\ncooked and mashed, put this pulp into the jelly bag, and allow\\nthe juice to drip as long as it will. Do not squeeze the bag,\\nnor stir the pulp if you wish clear jelly. This dripping process\\nis a matter of hours, and in the home kitchen may continue all\\nnight. Allow a pint of sugar to a pint of juice. Return the\\njuice to the kettle, and allow it to simmer for twenty-five\\nminutes or half an hour, skimming when necessary. In the\\nmeantime, heat the sugar, being careful not to melt or burn it.\\nStir the sugar gently into the juice, and boil five minutes.\\nTest a little upon a saucer. It should show signs of jellying as\\nit cools. Boil longer, if necessary. Finish as directed. Jelly\\noften does not set until twenty-four hours have elapsed.\\n107\\n2. Currant jelly.\\nThe method is the same as with apple jelly.\\nIt is not necessary to remove the currants from the stem. Heat\\njust long enough before the straining to make the juices flow\\nwell.\\nVery agreeable flavors are secured by the combining of two or\\nmore fruits in a jelly; quince and pineapple with apple;—a leaf\\nof rose geranium or lemon verbena in a glass of apple jelly;\\nraspberry with currant. White apple jelly may be flavored with\\nmint leaves, and used in place of mint sauce with meat.\\nPickling.\\nPickles are not desirable in the diet. If acid is craved, it is\\nmuch wiser to secure it by fresh fruits, and by the use of lemon\\njuice.\\nDrying.\\nThis process should not be discarded if there is a supply of\\nfruit in the orchard or garden. Place thinly sliced apples and\\npeaches upon plates or trays, protect by clean cheesecloth, and\\ndry in the sun. The color may be dark, but the flavor is\\nexcellent.\\nLaboratory management.—The fruit selected for use in the\\nschool kitchen depends upon the time of year. The autumn is the\\nseason for preserving, but some fruit is available at any time\\nof year: in the winter, apple and peach butter from the dried\\nfruit; in the spring rhubarb jam or jelly; in the late spring or\\nearly summer, strawberry jam. If the school program and the\\nequipment permit the serving of meals by the class, fruit may be\\npreserved in the fall for these occasions.\\nEXERCISES\\n1.

Other parts of\\nplants, however, besides the fruit are used as vegetables.\\nComposition and nutritive value.—Vegetables are much like fruits in\\ncomposition, being richest usually in carbohydrates and ash, but sometimes\\ncontaining a large amount of protein. Some have carbohydrates in the form\\nof starch, as the potato, and others in the form of sugar, as the beet;\\nyoung corn is rich in sugar, old corn in starch. All have more or less\\ncellulose, that in lettuce being very tender, while that in beets is so\\nfirm as to be softened only by long cooking. Study carefully Figs. 34 and\\n35. Notice how the amount of water compares with the amount in fruits.\\nSee, too, that beans, both green and dry, are richer in protein than other\\nvegetables. Celery has the highest percentage of water, and is valuable\\nfor its ash and the bulk it gives because of the large amount of\\ncellulose.',\n",

In the dry bean seed, and also in the pea and\\nlentil, the young plant lies dormant, with a large supply of all the\\nfoodstuffs ready for its first growth when warmth and moisture are\\nsupplied in the spring. Classified according to their nutritive value, the\\nvegetables rank as follows. Leaves are grouped with stems.',\n",

In this way, one may increase one’s knowledge of\\nvarieties for planting in the home garden, even if they are not common on\\nthe market. City markets offer an increasing variety of vegetables, and\\nthe purchaser should not hesitate to buy a vegetable because it is new to\\nher.

       " 'Uncooked vegetables.—Crisp vegetables with tender fiber are\\neaten raw. Their preparation includes freshening in cold water,\\nthorough washing to remove grit and insects, thorough drying by\\nshaking in a soft cloth or wire basket, and cooling on the ice.\\nLettuce should not be served so wet that the water collects on\\nthe plate, making it impossible to dress the salad with oil. See\\nsalad making, Chapter XV.\\nCooked vegetables.—Vegetable cooking is an art much neglected,\\nand in consequence vegetables are sometimes served lacking their\\nproper flavor and their original nutrients. To cook\\nvegetables115\\nin boiling salted water, throwing the water away, is not the\\ncorrect method, except in a few cases. With this method much of\\nthe valuable mineral matter and the flavoring substances are\\nlost in the water. With such strong flavored vegetables as the\\ncabbage, old onions and beets, and old potatoes this method is\\npermissible, but even in these cases the nutritive value is\\ndecreased.\\nPrinciples of cooking.—Softening of the fiber.\\nOpening of the starch granules, when starch is present, at a\\ntemperature of 212° F. Retaining mineral and flavoring matters.\\nCooking processes.—These rank in value as they do or do not\\nretain the mineral and flavoring matters.\\nBaking.—No nutritive material lost. The best method for\\npotatoes and sweet potatoes. Used also for squash, pumpkin,\\nbeets, young onions, dried beans, peas, and lentils.\\nSteaming. (Cooking in a steamer.)—No nutritive material lost.\\nA good method for all fresh vegetables. Steamed vegetables have\\nless flavor than baked.\\nStewing.—Cooking in a stew pan or kettle with so little water\\nthat it is almost boiled out at the end of the process, any\\nremaining liquid being served with the vegetable. The best\\nmethod for spinach, which can be cooked with no additional\\nwater, beyond that remaining on the leaves from the washing. The\\nFrench use this method almost entirely, and with tender peas and\\ncarrots they omit water and use butter only. A substitute for\\nthis latter is a very small amount of water, with the addition\\nof butterine or some good butter substitute.\\nBoiling.—Cooking in a large amount of boiling, salted water,\\nthe water to be drained off and thrown away. May be used with\\nold beets of rank flavor, strong onions, old potatoes, or\\npotatoes boiled with the skins on. A wasteful method.\\nAdjuncts.—Salt, pepper, butter, or some other fat, milk,\\ncheese, bread crumbs, parsley, eggs.\\nUtensils.—A vegetable brush, a sharp knife, a chopper, a potato\\nmasher, a strainer, a colander, a stew pan, kettle or steamer,\\nbaking pan, baking dish, bean pot, frying pan or kettle.\\nGeneral directions.—Wash the vegetables, scrubbing the skin\\nvegetables with a brush. Washing in several waters is important\\nwith spinach to remove all grit. Scrape off thin skins or pare\\noff the thicker. Thick skins such as those of old beets are more\\neasily116\\nremoved after cooking. The outer covering must be\\nremoved in the case of peas, shell beans, and sweet corn. Pull\\nor cut strings from string beans with great care. Discard all\\npoor portions. Remove and throw away the inner pulp and seeds of\\nold squashes and pumpkins. The whole of a tender summer squash\\nis eatable.\\nWhen boiling salted water is used, allow one tablespoonful of\\nsalt to four quarts of water. Steamed and stewed vegetables are\\nsalted and dressed with butter or butter substitute before\\nserving. Butter is a better dressing for vegetables than white\\nsauce. Where cream is available, nothing is so delicious. Use\\nwhite sauce very sparingly with some escalloped vegetable for\\nvariety. Making a sauce adds to the labor of preparation, and\\nthe sauce hides the delicious flavor of a well-cooked vegetable.\\nSome vegetables are mashed before serving; potatoes, turnip,\\nsquash, either boiled or baked.\\nTime of cooking.—The following table is a guide, but one must\\nlearn from practice, for the time depends upon the quality of\\nthe vegetable, whether tender or tough, and upon the size\\nwhether large or small. Test by gently inserting a fork.\\nAllow more time for cooking in a steamer, than for stewing or\\nboiling. It requires more time to bake a potato than to boil one\\nof the same size. Why?\\nTime-table\\n(For stewing and boiling unless stated otherwise.)\\nFifteen minutes.—Tender cabbage and sweet corn. These are\\nusually cooked too long.\\nThirty minutes.—Asparagus; peas; potatoes of medium size;\\nsummer squash; tomatoes.\\nForty-five minutes.—Young beets and carrots; onions; young\\nparsnips; medium potatoes baked, sweet potatoes boiled.\\nOne hour.—String and shelled beans; cauliflower; oyster\\nplant; winter squash, steamed or baked; young turnips.\\nTwo hours.—Old carrots, beets, and turnips.\\nSix to eight hours (or more).—Dried beans, lentils, and peas,\\nbaked in the oven, with water added.\\nThe potato, a starchy vegetable.—Make it your pride to serve a\\nplain potato, mealy and inviting. Potatoes are “new,” fully\\nripe, and old. The new potato is in market in July and August,\\nand may be recognized by its very thin skin. The later potatoes\\nhave a thicker skin, the color still being fresh. In the spring\\nafter117\\nits winter storage, the potato is “old.” It seems a\\nlittle less firm, the color of the exterior is somewhat changed;\\nperhaps the buds in the eyes of the potato are beginning to\\ngrow. When cooked it has a stronger flavor, and rather darker\\ncolor. If the potato has been frozen, a sweet flavor is\\ndeveloped, and the quality is waxy. Potatoes are sometimes\\ninferior in quality when the season is a poor one, or when some\\npotato disease is prevalent. The following classification shows\\nyou in how many ways potatoes may be cooked, and also shows you\\nhow easy it is to classify recipes in an orderly way.\\nI. Potatoes cooked whole.\\n1. Steamed.\\na. With skin.\\nb. Without skin.\\n2. Boiled.\\na. With skin.\\nb. Without skin.\\n3. Baked.\\na. With skin.\\nb. Without skin.\\nII. Potatoes, not whole.\\n1. From raw potatoes.\\na. Sliced and escalloped.\\nb. Cut in cubes and stewed.\\nc. Cut in slices or fancy shapes and fried.\\n2. From cooked potatoes.\\na. Mashed.\\n(a) From boiled potatoes, plain or browned on top.\\n(b) From baked potatoes, seasoned and served in shell.\\nb. Creamed. From either cold-boiled or baked potatoes;\\nthe latter are better.\\nc. Sauté.\\n(a) Sliced and browned.\\n(b) Hashed and browned.\\nIf you know some other method, see if you can fit it into this\\ngrouping.\\n1. Baked potatoes.\\nMethod 1. The best method, for new potatoes. Select those\\nof uniform size. When scrubbed, place them in a\\nshallow118\\npan, or upon the rack of the oven. The oven should be hot,\\nabout 450° F. or even a higher temperature. (See oven tests,\\nChapter IX.) The length of time required depends upon the\\nsize of the potato, forty-five minutes being the average time.\\nA potato is largely water. What is the temperature of the\\ninterior of the potato during the baking process?\\nTest by pressing firmly, protecting the fingers by a soft cloth;\\nor insert a fork. When the potato is done, it yields to the\\npressure of the fingers. If the potatoes cannot be served at\\nonce, break the skin that the steam may escape, cover with a\\ncloth, and keep them hot.\\nFor convenience at the table, cut the potatoes in two lengthwise,\\nloosen the content of each half with a fork, sprinkle with salt,\\nand add a bit of butter, as much as one would add at the table.\\nPotato on the half shell carries serving one step farther.\\nCut the baked potatoes in two lengthwise, remove the contents,\\nmash lightly, add butter or butterine, milk, and salt, allowing\\na teaspoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of milk and a\\nshake or two of salt to each potato. These measurements cannot\\nbe given with exactness, because potatoes vary in size. Beat\\nthis mixture well, replace lightly in each half shell, and brown\\nthe tops slightly. This is nothing more than mashed baked\\npotato, prettily served.\\nInvent other variations of this dish, adding ingredients that\\nare agreeable when mixed with the potato. The beaten white\\nof an egg added, gives greater lightness to the mixture in the\\npotato shell.\\nMethod 2. The same as Method 1, except that the potatoes\\nare pared before baking. A good method when the skins are\\nnot fair. A brown crust is formed on the potato, which is\\ncrisp and pleasant to eat. Large potatoes may be cut in two\\nbefore baking, or even sliced.\\nWhat difference in length of baking will there be between\\nMethods 1 and 2?\\n2. Boiled potatoes.\\nThe only way to prevent the loss of nutrients in using this\\nprocess is to boil the potatoes with the “jackets” on. This\\nis the best way with new potatoes. This method with ripe\\nand old potatoes gives a yellowish color to the surface\\nand119\\nindeed throughout. It is a labor-saving method for the busy\\nhousewife, as the skin cracks and loosens at the end of the\\nboiling process, and is easily removed.\\nIf you choose to have a snow-white potato, it must be pared\\nbefore boiling, and thus you deliberately waste the valuable\\nmineral matter provided by nature. If your income permits\\nthis æsthetic pleasure, the mineral matter can of course be\\nsupplied in other vegetables. The woman who can spend but\\ntwenty to thirty cents per capita for food per day should boil\\nthe potatoes with the skins on and gratify her artistic sense in\\nsome other way.\\nThe method of boiling is the same in either case, whether the\\npotato is pared or not.\\nHave enough boiling water to cover the potatoes. Put the\\npotatoes of uniform size one at a time into the kettle that\\nthe boiling may not stop. Allow a gentle boiling to continue\\nuntil the potatoes are done. Why avoid rapid boiling? Test\\nwith a fork at the end of half an hour. When the potatoes\\nare mellow, drain off the water, and set the kettle where the\\nremaining moisture will steam off. Shake gently to hasten\\nthis process, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt. If they must\\nstand before serving will you place a tin cover or a cloth over\\nthe kettle? Old potatoes, with a strong flavor, should be pared\\nbefore boiling, or even soaked in cold water.\\n3. Mashed potatoes.—Some one devised this convenient method of\\nserving, to save trouble at the table. Mashed potato can be\\nvery poor and unappetizing when wet and lumpy. Do not attempt\\nit with new, poor, or old potatoes. See that the boiled\\npotatoes are as dry as can be—every particle of water steamed\\naway. Mash thoroughly with the wire masher, add butter or\\nbutterine, salt and milk in about the proportions given for potato\\nin the half shell. Use a tablespoonful or so of cream if it is available.\\nBeat vigorously. The mealiness of the potato and the\\nvigorous beating are the secrets of success. The finished product\\nshould be light and somewhat moist,—not wet. Reheat in the\\nkettle. Pile lightly in a hot dish and serve; or brown the top\\nbefore serving.\\nPotato puff. (Soufflé.)—With your knowledge of mashed\\npotato, can you not invent a potato puff?\\n120\\n4. Escalloped potato.—The name escalloped is applied to any\\nbaked dish that is arranged in layers. Escalloped potato\\nis a palatable dish and this is one of the most economical of\\nmethods.\\nWash, pare, and slice the potatoes in 1⁄4-inch pieces. Slightly\\ngrease an earthen or enameled baking dish. Cover the bottom\\nof the dish with a layer of the slices, sprinkle the slices lightly\\nwith flour, and put on two teaspoonfuls of butter, or butterine,\\nin small bits. Continue until the dish is nearly full. Pour\\nin milk to barely cover the potatoes, put a cover on the dish\\nand set the dish in an oven of 380° F. Remove the cover in\\ntime to allow the top to brown. Allow rather more than half\\nan hour for the baking.\\n5. Creamed potatoes.—Method 1, an easy way. Chop cold baked\\npotatoes with the chopper. Allow one tablespoonful of butter\\nto 1 pint of chopped potato. Melt the butter in a saucepan.\\nStir in the potatoes. Shake from the dredger the equivalent\\nof a tablespoonful of flour, stirring the potato with one\\nhand as you shake with the other. Pour in enough milk to\\nbarely cover the chopped potato. Set the saucepan in the\\ncoolest spot on the range; or on the simmering burner of a gas\\nrange, upon an asbestos mat; or turn all into an earthenware\\njar, or baking dish, and proceed as with escalloped potato.\\nAllow the mixture to cook until it becomes creamy.\\nMethod 2. Cut the cold potatoes in cubes, and heat in a\\nthin white sauce. See Chapter X.\\nBoiled potatoes may be used, but baked are better in texture\\nand flavor for creaming.\\n6. French fried potatoes.—Wash and pare small potatoes, cut in\\neighths lengthwise, and soak a few minutes in cold water.\\nTake from water, dry between towels, and fry in deep fat.\\nDrain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt.\\n(1) Deep fat frying.—An iron kettle is the best for deep\\nfat, 3 quarts a convenient size. A wire basket is almost necessary\\nfor frying soft material.\\nFill the kettle 1⁄2 full of fat and place over fire. When a\\nslight blue smoke or vapor rises from it, it is ready to test.\\nTest with small cubes of bread. If bread browns in 1 minute,\\nthe temperature is right for uncooked mixtures. If it\\nbrowns121\\nin 10 seconds, it is right for cooked materials. Care must be\\ntaken to keep the temperatures at the right point, for if too cool,\\nthe material will soak fat; if too hot, both fat and material to\\nbe cooked will burn.\\n(2) To clarify fat.—Drop several slices raw, pared potato\\ninto the fat and let bubble up. Strain all through cheesecloth\\nback into pail from which fat was taken. The potatoes seem\\nto absorb food odors and collect crumbs and leave the fat\\nclear.\\n7. Stewed celery.—A green vegetable. Stalks of celery, too\\ntough or coarse for serving uncooked, are delicious when\\nstewed. The process is simple. Wash, scrape, and cut the\\nstalks crosswise. Place them in a stewpan, barely cover with\\nhot water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of celery.\\nCook gently for half an hour or until the celery is tender. Use\\nthe liquid remaining in making a sauce, adding some milk\\nto make the necessary amount of liquid. Three fourths of a cup\\nof sauce is enough for a pint of celery. See Chapter X.\\n8. Cabbage.—The method given makes cabbage a delicious and\\nattractive vegetable, as delicate as cauliflower, and the odor\\nin the kitchen is not noticeable.\\nSelect a small cabbage, with the ribs in the leaves not too\\nthick. Prepare the cabbage before washing it by cutting out\\nthe stalks from below with a sharp knife. Separate the leaves.\\nHave ready the largest kettle available, nearly full of rapidly\\nboiling water. Drop in one cabbage leaf at a time, pressing\\neach one down with a long-handled spoon or skimmer. Do\\nthis so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. Leave the\\nkettle uncovered, and allow the cabbage to cook from 12 to\\n15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the leaf stalks.\\nRemove the leaves with a long-handled skimmer, putting them\\ninto a colander standing on a plate. Immediately pour the hot\\nwater down the sink drain, turn on the cold water to flush\\naway the odor, and fill the kettle with cold water. While\\nthe cabbage is cooking, you have made a pint of white sauce,\\nNo. 2 (Ch. X), adding a teaspoonful of salt, and have prepared\\n1⁄2 cup of buttered crumbs. Cut the cabbage leaves slightly,\\nplace them in a baking dish, pour the white sauce over them,\\nsprinkle the crumbs on the top, and brown the crumbs in\\nthe122\\noven or under the gas. If you can, prepare this as a surprise\\nat home, and ask the family to “guess” what it is. If the\\ncabbage is a good one, some of the leaves turn a very pretty\\ngreen with this method of boiling.\\n9. Baked beans.—A nitrogenous vegetable and a meat substitute.\\nA dish known in old days in New England, baked\\nto perfection in the old brick oven. Baked beans seem difficult\\nof digestion for some people. The mustard is supposed\\nto be helpful, and adds something to the flavor. If the molasses\\nis omitted, or but a small amount used, and if butter\\ntakes the place of pork or suet, the beans seem more digestible.\\nIn different parts of New England the dish is varied. Some\\npeople prefer rather dry baked beans, others wish them moist\\nand very sweet.\\nUtensils.—A kettle. A covered bean pot.\\nIngredients.—\\n1 quart of white beans.\\n1 teaspoonful of soda.\\n1⁄4 lb. salt pork or more, or\\n4 tablespoonfuls of beef fat or butter substitute.\\nMolasses, from two tablespoonfuls to 1⁄2 cup,\\nor none.\\n1 teaspoonful of mustard.\\nMethod.—Wash, and soak the beans in cold water over\\nnight. Pour off any water that remains. Put the beans into\\nthe kettle, cover with cold water, add the soda, and cook gently\\nuntil the beans are slightly softened. The soda aids the softening.\\nPour off the water again, and put the beans into the\\npot. Mix the molasses and mustard with a pint of water, and\\npour this over the beans, adding more water if the beans are\\nnot covered. Place the pork or other fat upon the beans, and\\ncover the pot. If fat other than pork is used, salt must be\\nadded to the beans. The beans should bake slowly, for from\\n6 to 8 hours, and even longer in a very slow oven. A stove\\nof the type shown in Fig. 17 is good for this purpose.\\nThey123\\ncan be baked in the ordinary gas oven, if only one burner is\\nused, and that is turned very low.\\nLaboratory management.—The last experiment is the only one\\nnot easily performed in the school kitchen. The process, can\\nbegin perhaps on one day, and be finished the next. If there is\\nsome apparatus that cooks at a low temperature, the practical\\ndifficulties may be overcome.\\nVegetable, or “cream” soups.\\nThese are of two classes: the purées (porridge), or thick soups,\\nwith vegetable pulp as the thickening material, and the cream\\nsoups, which are somewhat thinner, the juices of some vegetable\\ngiving the flavor.\\nPotato purée, or soup, is an example of the first; cream of\\ntomato of the second. The line is not sharply drawn between the\\ntwo in many cook books. Milk is an important ingredient in these\\nsoups, so that they are sometimes known as milk soups. Butter\\nand flour are used in both,—the flour in the purée “binds” the\\nmixture and makes it smoother; in the cream soup the flour is\\nused for thickening as well.\\nDried beans, peas, or lentils make a delicious purée, the secret\\nof success being long slow cooking in some low temperature\\napparatus. They are brought to perfection in the Atkinson\\nCooker.\\n10. Potato Pureé.\\nIngredients.',\n",

       " '126\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nCEREAL PRODUCTS\\nThe common grains, sometimes called\\ncereals,[11]\\nyield some of the most\\nimportant of all the food materials. Those most widely used are wheat,\\nmaize, or Indian corn, oats, rice, barley, rye, and millet. In this\\ncountry wheat and corn are the two great crops upon which our prosperity\\nlargely depends, and a shortage in one of these crops is felt in the\\nbusiness world, not only in this country, but abroad. Rice is the\\nimportant cereal in China, Japan, and India, and a failure of the rice\\ncrop may mean famine to millions of people, especially in India. These\\nfacts are mentioned to show that the race has learned to depend upon the\\ngrains as a staple food, and a study of their composition proves that this\\ncommon habit is founded in reason. The grains are all members of the grass\\nfamily, and the edible portion is the seed. From these seeds are\\nmanufactured pure starch, breakfast cereals, meal, and flour. Like beans\\nand peas, these seeds are the storehouses of food for the young plants,\\nand we therefore find the high nutritive value depicted in Fig. 37. Notice\\nthat the carbohydrate (starch) content is high in all; that all contain\\nprotein, oats, wheat, and rye being about equal in this and higher than\\nthe others; oats are highest in fat, corn ranking next. The ash contains\\nthe same important mineral substances that we found in the fruits, the\\npercentages of each differing somewhat with\\nthe128\\ndifferent grains and\\nbeing quite different for the cereals as a class than for the fruits and\\nvegetables as a class. It must be remembered that these percentages are\\ngiven for the whole grain, and that the amounts of the nutrients in the\\nmanufactured product depend upon the process employed.\\nManufacture of cereal food\\nmaterials.[12]—The\\nprimitive method of making\\nthe material in the grain available for use was by grinding the grain\\nbetween two stones, or by pounding one stone upon another, and this method\\nis used by the Mexicans and certain of the American Indians to this day,\\nhuman muscle being the power employed. Wind and water were harnessed for\\ngrinding grain, and were the only motive powers available until the\\ninvention of steam, the grinding being done by stones. In a Connecticut\\ntown there still exists a mill stone, one of a pair so small that they\\nwere carried into the settlement on horseback, and when placed in a small\\nmill by a brook, they ground a bushel of corn in a day.',\n",

       " 'Breakfast cereals and meal are now made in the great factories that\\nproduce flour; steam is the motive power and the grains are broken, or\\nrolled, between steel rollers. (See Chapter XII.)\\nBreakfast cereals.—The ready-to-eat breakfast cereal has met the popular\\ndemand for a quickly prepared food for the first meal of the day. A few of\\nthese are made under known conditions, but they are sometimes manufactured\\nfrom inferior grain, and the presence of grit at times indicates a\\npossible lack of cleanliness in the process. It is a question, too,\\nwhether or not the starch has been subjected to heat for a sufficient\\nlength of time, and whether they can be masticated sufficiently to make\\nthe grain digestible, and the nutritive material available. Their use for\\nyoung children is undesirable. For older people, they add\\nvariety129\\nto the\\ndiet, but they are usually more expensive than the home-cooked breakfast\\nfoods, even when the cost of fuel is taken into account. See Fig. 38.\\nCooked breakfast cereals.—It is an easy task to cook a cereal, especially\\nnow that the fireless cooker in some form is present in so many homes. The\\ncereal for breakfast does not necessitate early rising; as it may be\\nprepared the day or evening before and be served in palatable form in the\\nmorning.\\nThe most common breakfast cereals are made from oats, wheat, and corn,\\nvarying in fineness of grain from those ground like a meal to the coarser\\ncracked wheat and the samp made from corn. It is well to use kinds made\\nfrom different grains, but when the worth of a few has been proved, it is\\nnot wise to try another kind simply because it has a new label. One\\nmanufacturer confessed to a visitor that the same cereal was put into\\nboxes of different colors and sold under different names as a means of\\ninviting purchasers. The cereal foods made from whole grains are\\nespecially valuable on account of the high mineral content.\\nIt usually pays to buy in boxes, rather than in bulk, in the case of\\ncereals; and always from a reliable grocer. If you purchase a box of\\ncereal as a “bargain,” weigh its contents and compare the weight with the\\nweight of a box bought in the regular way. Also examine such a box for the\\npresence of insects. These may be recognized sometimes by a webby\\nsubstance, and again the insects themselves may be detected. Do not buy\\ntoo large a stock of cereals, since they are better when they are fresh\\nfrom the factory, and a good firm renews its stock often.',\n",

       " '131\\n2. Complete opening of the starch granules by the boiling\\ntemperature of water.\\n3. The protein present presents no special problem. Its\\ndigestibility is not especially affected, but the softening of\\nthe fiber of the cereal makes the protein available to us.\\nMethods.—There are two classes into which the cereals may be\\ndivided,—the flaked and the granular. The weighing experiments\\n(page 62) show that the granular is the heavier. This means that\\nmore water will be absorbed by a given measure of the granular,\\nbecause it contains more material.\\nIn experimenting with a cereal at home it is well to try the\\nproportion of water and cereal printed on the box the first\\ntime, altering the proportion if the first result is not\\nsatisfactory. There should be enough water to soften the cereal,\\nand only just enough. If the cooked cereal is stiff, the\\nmeasure of water is short; if so thin that the cereal runs on\\nthe plate, too much water was allowed.\\n1. Preparation of breakfast cereal.\\nIngredients.',\n",
       " '1 part, by measure, flaked cereal to 2 of water.\\n1 part granular cereal to 3 to 4 of water.\\n1 cup of dry cereal will serve three or four people.\\nSamp, cracked wheat, and coarse corn meal will take from 4 to 6 parts of water.\\nSalt. A tablespoonful to a quart of water is an average amount.',\n",
       " 'Utensils: a measuring cup; a double boiler; a fork.\\nMethod.—Measure the cereal and water, put the water into the\\ninner part of the double boiler with the salt. Have the\\nlower part of the boiler ready—about half full of hot water;\\nplace the inner boiler directly upon the stove or over the flame.\\nWhen the water is boiling rapidly, shake the cereal into the water\\nfrom a cup, so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. This\\nis the first secret of a well-cooked cereal. The rapidly boiling\\nwater keeps the grains of cereal in motion, and thus they do\\nnot stick to the vessel nor to each other, and the heat reaches\\nthe starch in the grains equally. If the grains begin to settle,\\nshake the vessel gently, but do not stir, even with a fork.\\nAllow this process to continue for about five minutes, or until\\nyou see a thickening of the mass, so much so that the\\nseparate132\\ngrains do not settle. If toward the end of this stage there is\\ndanger of sticking, lift the mass with the fork, but do not stir\\nit, as this motion will break the grains. This first process\\nopens the starch grains. Place the inner part of the boiler\\nin the outer over boiling water and allow the cooking to continue\\nfor at least one hour. For this is the second secret of the\\nperfect cereal,—a long-continued process that softens the\\nfiber and develops flavor. One cereal, advertised as being\\ncooked in three minutes, remains unpalatable after that length\\nof time, but is delicious at the end of two hours. If you have a\\nfireless cooker, put the cereal in the double boiler into the\\ncooker overnight for the second stage. Any low temperature\\napparatus gives the desired result.\\n2. The uses of cold cereal.—Never throw away cooked cereals.\\nThe cold cereal is useful in many ways.\\n(a) Mold in small cups with dates or other fruit, and serve\\nwith sugar and cream for luncheon.\\n(b) Cool corn meal mush in a flat dish, cut it in slices when\\ncold, and brown the slices in a frying pan, with beef fat, or\\na butter substitute. Serve with sugar, molasses, or sirup for\\nbreakfast or luncheon.\\n(c) Rice or hominy may be mixed with a beaten egg, molded\\ninto small cakes, and browned either in the frying pan, or\\nin the oven.\\n(d) A small remaining portion of any cereal may be used to\\nthicken soup.\\n(e) Any cooked cereal may be used in muffins or even yeast\\nbread. (See those chapters.)\\n3. Corn meal “mush.”—This is cooked by the same method as\\nthe other cereals, except that the amount of water is larger\\nand the first boiling should continue longer. The meal must\\nbe scattered slowly into the boiling water, or else be mixed\\nfirst with cold water, as it lumps very easily. The second stage\\nof the process should continue several hours.\\nRice.—Rice varies very much in quality and in the shape of the grain.\\nLouisiana and Chinese rice are among those that have a firm and large\\ngrain keeping its shape well\\nwhen133\\ncooked. Inferior varieties become too\\nsoft, and the finished product is pasty and poor in color and flavor. Much\\nis said at present about the harmful effect of the polishing process upon\\nthe quality of the rice. An unpolished rice may sometimes be found on the\\nmarket, brownish in color and with a good flavor.',\n",
       " '4. Boiled rice.—Rice may be cooked in the double boiler by the\\nsame method as other cereals, allowing 1 part of rice to 3 of\\nwater. The rice should be well washed in cold water.\\nThe second stage need not be continued so long, from three\\nquarters of an hour to an hour being sufficient. The flavor is\\nimproved by the use of milk in place of half of the water. By\\nthis method the nutritive value is much increased.\\nAnother method used by the Chinese continues the boiling\\nthroughout the whole process. A very large amount of water\\nis used, several quarts for one cup of rice, and when the water\\nis boiling violently the rice is scattered in very slowly. The\\nboiling continues from twenty minutes to half an hour, or until\\nthe grains are tender, and then the water is drained off, through\\na colander. The rice in the colander should then be placed\\nwhere the remaining moisture will steam off. By this method\\nnutrients are lost, but the grains of the rice stand out distinctly\\nand are light and dry. It is a difficult method for the\\nnovice, because its success depends upon the removal of the\\nrice from the water just at the moment it is tender, but not too\\nsoft. The grains should be tested in twenty minutes.\\nCorn products.—Corn being our most abundant grain, it is the cheapest,\\nand we should promote its use. Hominy and samp and Indian meal, when well\\ncooked, are all most palatable. There is a difference between old and new\\nprocess corn meal, to be noticed in the flavor and in the behavior of the\\ntwo kinds in cooking. The new process meal now more largely on the market\\nhas been deprived of the germ, which contains a large amount of oil, and\\nalthough the meal does not deteriorate so soon, there is some loss of\\nflavor.\\nMoreover,134\\nwhen the new process meal is used in an old-time\\nrecipe, more wetting must be used than the recipe calls for and a larger\\namount of fat.\\nThe old process of grinding between stones is still employed in some\\nlocalities. Southern and Rhode Island corn meal are ground in this way,\\nand may be found at some groceries. There are also two colors, the yellow\\nand the white, each with a distinctive flavor, and some people who think\\nthey dislike corn meal find the white meal agreeable.\\nPure starches.—These occur as food materials in several forms. Cornstarch\\nis the starchy portion only removed from the grain of corn. Wheat starch\\nis more largely used for laundry purposes than for food. Rice flour may be\\ntreated as starch in cooking. Arrowroot is a fine starch from the roots of\\na family of plants growing in the West Indies and other warm climates. It\\nis used principally in cooking for invalids. Cassava, manioca, tapioca,\\nand sago are starchy materials in granular form. The first three are made\\nfrom the pith of the cassava plant, the sago from the sago palm. The pure\\nstarches are all easily digested and inexpensive. Corn starch is the most\\nabundant and cheapest pure starch in this country.\\nThe starch granule.—To understand the behavior of materials like\\ncornstarch, rice flour, and arrowroot in cooking, we need to know more of\\nthe starch grain. Cornstarch is composed of myriads of tiny granules\\nsomewhat like those pictured in Fig. 39, but smaller. The starch granules\\nof different plants differ in size and even in shape, but they all have a\\ncovering lying in folds, the pure starch being within. The granule unfolds\\nor bursts when exposed to heat. When these granules are floating in water,\\nand, being heated, open at the same moment, the starch paste is smooth;\\notherwise, the starch lumps.',\n",

       " '138\\nCHAPTER IX\\nEGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE\\nEggs are a specially interesting food because they contain all the\\nelements necessary to the development of the young chick within the shell.\\nThe structure of the egg is familiar, with its division into the yolk and\\nwhite, and it is interesting to note the details of this structure.\\nBreak a fresh egg carefully into a saucer. The shell is porous, allowing\\nwater to evaporate from the egg and air to enter. To this porosity is due\\nthe fact that other substances may enter the egg, giving it an unnatural\\nflavor and even hastening its deterioration. Within the shell is a fine\\nmembrane which protects the white. The yolk is also divided from the white\\nby a more delicate membrane which enables one to separate the yolk from\\nthe white of a fresh egg. A careful examination reveals at each end of the\\nyolk a continuation of this membrane in the form of small cords which are\\nfastened at each end of the shell, holding the yolk evenly suspended in\\nthe center of the shell. Rough handling or jolting breaks this membrane,\\nand the yolk drops to one side.\\nLift the white carefully with a fork, and notice its elasticity. This\\ncohesive property makes it possible to beat air into the white until the\\nwhole mass become porous. The yolk is creamy rather than light when\\nbeaten, and a bit of the yolk mixed with the white prevents the latter\\nfrom becoming light and dry.',\n",
       " '140\\nComposition of the egg.—Figure 40 gives the composition of the yolk and\\nwhite taken together, and of the yolk and white separated. The protein\\ncontent is high, and the fat content as well, the yolk containing a higher\\npercentage of these two foodstuffs than the white. The mineral matter is\\nof high value, iron and phosphorus being found in ideal forms in the yolk.\\nIn using the egg as food we are availing ourselves of one of nature’s\\nrichest storehouses. A single egg of average size yields about 75\\ncalories, of which 60 come from the yolk and 15 from the white. A very\\nlarge egg, weighing two and two thirds ounces, will yield 100 calories.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 40.—Composition of eggs and cheese.',\n",
       " 'Fresh eggs and cold storage eggs.—The fresh-laid egg is always desired\\nfor its delicious flavor, and this flavor changes but little in a week or\\ntwo if the egg is kept cool. It is desirable to preserve eggs, however,\\nfor future use at the season when they are most abundant and cheap. Many\\nmethods have been tried, such as laying them away in sawdust, sinking them\\nin water-glass solution, or coating the shell with paraffin or some other\\nsubstance to prevent evaporation and the entrance of air. The introduction\\nof cold storage on a large scale promises a solution of the problem. If\\neggs are fresh when placed in storage, it is possible to keep them just\\nabove the freezing temperature for months without appreciable\\ndeterioration.\\nEggs too long in storage may be detected by the musty odor and flavor, the\\nrunning of the yolk into the white, and the thin quality of the white\\nwhich prevents beating stiff. Some states have already passed stringent\\nlaws in regard to the sale of cold storage eggs.\\nThe cost of eggs and how to buy.—The demand for fresh eggs is great, and\\nso many eggs are exported, that the price is high, even in the summer.\\nTwenty-five cents a dozen is a reasonable price, but this is below the\\naverage at the\\npresent141\\ndate. The thirty-five or forty-cent daily\\nallowance for food will permit the moderate use of eggs at thirty-five\\ncents a dozen, but not a liberal use in cakes and desserts. They should be\\nused at such a price and with that allowance as the main dish for\\nbreakfast or luncheon at times, and not in sweet dishes calling for three\\nor four eggs. If a recipe for soft custard calls for three eggs to a pint\\nof milk, leave out one egg or even two, and use one or two tablespoonfuls\\nof cornstarch instead. Select eggs with a hard shell, and yolk of rich\\nyellow. If the shell is soft and the yolk pale, these deficiencies should\\nbe reported, as they can be corrected by the poultryman. The difference in\\ncolor of the shells, whether white or brown, is not of great consequence.\\nIf you can buy eggs by the crate direct from the poultryman, this is a\\nsaving, provided the eggs can be used before they deteriorate. A small\\ncrate holds fifteen dozen; the usual size thirty dozen. Some express\\ncompanies have a special rate for eggs, and parcel post should aid in this\\nmethod of buying.\\nRelative digestibility of soft and hard-cooked eggs.—The fact must be\\nrecalled that to digest is to dissolve, and that the digestion of food\\nmeans a dissolving by the digestive juices, aided by water. When we speak\\nof the digestibility of food we may mean the ease and comfort of\\ndigestion, or the length of time taken by the process, or the completeness\\nof the process. If we take the third of these meanings, hard-cooked egg is\\nas digestible as the soft-cooked or the raw egg, because it is completely\\ndissolved in digestion in the course of time. If the second meaning of\\ndigestion is taken, the hard-cooked egg may be slightly less digestible,\\nfor a slightly longer time is consumed in the process. The latest\\nresearches, however, show that the digestive process is longer with any\\nfood than was formerly supposed, and the difference in this case is not\\nespecially important. Indeed, we must\\naccept142\\nthe conclusions of the\\nscientist and frankly admit that the differences of temperature in cooking\\nof egg do not have any great effect upon its digestibility.\\nWhy then the popular idea that a hard-boiled egg is “absolutely\\nindigestible”? A hard-boiled egg, or more than one, eaten rapidly, without\\nmastication, at a picnic, and with much sweet food at an unusual hour, may\\ninterfere with the “ease and comfort in digestion” resulting from such a\\nmeal. But if the whites of the hard-boiled eggs are chopped fine, the yolk\\nmashed, and the two served upon toast, thus insuring mastication, a dish\\nis produced that is of average digestibility and that may be used for\\nbreakfast or luncheon without hesitation.\\nIf a tender, jellylike consistency is wanted, cook the egg below the\\nboiling point of water. If, however, a firmer egg is preferred, use the\\nold-time method, and cook the egg three or four minutes in boiling water.\\nIt is the easier and quicker method.\\nMoreover, do not hesitate to use an egg “boiled” half an hour, provided it\\nis chopped fine or sliced.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " '1. Eggs used raw.—An egg, swallowed whole, followed by a cracker,\\nis a “quick lunch” that is not harmful, and it is sometimes\\nconvenient to be able to take an egg in this way. A sprinkling\\nof salt upon it makes it more agreeable.\\n2. Beaten eggs.—Beat the yolk and white separately. Add to\\nthe yolk a teaspoonful of sugar, a shake of salt, some flavoring,\\nand 3⁄4 of a cup of milk. Beat the white gently into this\\nmixture and serve in a glass. The flavoring may be a quarter\\nof a teaspoonful of vanilla, or a tablespoonful of orange juice.\\nThis is sometimes served to an invalid who can take milk, and\\nis an agreeable luncheon for any one. If milk does not agree\\nwith one, a larger amount of fruit juice may be used with the\\naddition of some water, possibly carbonated. The\\nwhite143\\nalone is given in cases of severe illness, mixed with a small\\namount of water, and fruit juice if the physician permits the\\nlatter. This is sometimes the only food that can be retained\\nby an invalid.\\nPrinciples of egg cookery.—Protein in the form of an\\negg-albumin is the foodstuff to consider in the cooking of eggs.\\nHeat produces in the egg a change in color and in texture or\\nfirmness, the firmness or hardness depending upon the degree of\\nheat and the length of time given to the cooking. Coagulation is\\nthe term used for this change in the egg-albumin.\\n1. The white of egg begins to coagulate and to show an opaque\\nwhite at about 180° F.\\n2. A temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water for\\nabout ten minutes will give the white a jellylike, tender\\nconsistency, and slightly cook the yolk. Continued for an hour,\\nthe white becomes solid and adheres to the shell.\\n3. The boiling point of water gives a firmer consistency than a\\ntemperature below this point. The white is free from the shell.\\n4. A high temperature, that of a hot pan, will produce a\\nleathery consistency if long continued.\\nA. An experiment with the egg.\\nApparatus and materials.—A ring stand, wire net, Bunsen burner,\\nglass beaker, test tube, chemical thermometer, white of egg.\\nMethod.—Put the beaker two thirds full of water on the wire\\nnet over the flame. Put enough white of egg into the test tube\\nto cover the bulb of the thermometer when this is put into the\\ntube. Clamp the test tube so that it rests in the water in the\\nbeaker. The surface of the water should stand above the top of\\nthe white of egg. Clamp the thermometer so that it is held in\\nthe white of egg in the test tube. The white should be stirred\\nwith a fork before it is put into the test tube, and only a\\nsmall quantity used.\\nNote:\\n1. The temperature when the first visible change occurs.\\n2. The temperature when the whole mass becomes of a jellylike consistency.\\n3. The temperature when the water reaches the boiling point. Remove; note the consistency.\\n3. Jellied or coddled eggs.—See that the shells are whole and clean.\\nIf the eggs are just taken from the refrigerator, lay them\\nin144\\nwarm water a few minutes. Make ready a double boiler, the\\nlower part half full of boiling water. Put the required number\\nof eggs into the inner boiler, cover with water that has just\\nstopped boiling, put on the boiler cover, and stand the boiler\\nwhere the water below will no longer boil. The eggs will be\\ndone in from six to eight minutes.\\nHaving performed the preceding experiment, you should be\\nable to invent another way of accomplishing this result.\\n4. Boiled eggs.\\nPut one egg at a time from a tablespoon into\\nboiling water. Allow the water to boil for three or four\\nminutes, depending upon the preference of those served.\\nRemove the eggs, and serve at once.\\nThe hard-boiled egg should remain in the boiling water half\\nan hour.\\nBearing in mind the fact that hard-boiled eggs must be\\nchopped or sliced, cannot you invent a way of using them in a\\nluncheon dish?\\n5. Poached eggs.—Make ready a frying pan by setting muffin\\nrings in it, and filling it about half full of gently simmering\\nwater, with a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Break the\\neggs one at a time into a saucer, and slip each egg carefully into\\na muffin ring. See that the pan stands where the water is just\\nbelow the boiling point, for rapidly bubbling water breaks the\\neggs. When the white begins to set, pour the hot water\\ngently over the tops of the eggs from a spoon. Cook until the\\nwhite is firm. Slip a griddle cake turner under the egg, lift\\nit gently, and place it upon a piece of buttered toast which\\nyou have ready on a hot plate, or platter, and remove the ring.\\nAn easier method resembling the poached egg is to break\\nthe egg raw into a small buttered cup or “patty,” standing the\\ncups in a pan of water just below the boiling point, the pan\\nbeing on the top of the stove or in the oven. Each egg should\\nhave a sprinkling of salt, and may have a bit of butter, and a\\nshake of pepper. Cover the pan. This process is longer than\\nthe other, and the eggs must be watched to see when the\\nprocess is complete.\\n6. Scrambled eggs.\\nAs the name denotes, this is a process needing\\na quick motion. Allow an egg to each person. Have\\nready145\\na frying pan heated, a broad bladed knife, and a tablespoonful\\nof butter, or butter substitute, ready to melt in the pan.\\n(1) Melt the butter, break the eggs into the pan, without\\nbeating them, and begin to scrape them from the bottom of\\nthe pan with the knife, as fast as you can move your hand.\\nThis is an old-time method, and gives a mixture of white and\\nyellow color. Stop the process when the eggs are softer than\\nyou wish them for serving, as they will stiffen after they are\\nremoved from the fire. Sprinkle in salt, before you give\\nthe last scramble, and serve at once.\\n(2) Beat the eggs, adding a tablespoonful of water for each\\negg, and a shake of salt for each, and proceed as in (1).\\n7. The omelet.\\nThe novice should see an omelet made, as there\\nis a “knack” in the motion not to be conveyed by words.\\nThe omelet is a French dish, and is made to perfection by the\\nFrench cook. A perfect omelet is rolled or folded over, and is\\ncreamy within and a golden brown without. “Omelet pans”\\nare made for the purpose, but a small frying pan may be used.\\nThe pan should be perfectly smooth. Do not attempt to\\nmake an omelet with more than two eggs until you become\\nexpert. This is one method, and others are used by different\\nFrench cooks. The first stage makes the whole mass creamy,\\nthe second browns one surface.\\n(1) Have the pan warm enough to melt two teaspoonfuls of\\nbutter, but not hot. Beat two eggs with a fork until they are\\ncreamy but not foamy, and add two teaspoonfuls of water,\\nwith two shakes of salt.\\nPut the mixture into the pan, standing the pan where it\\nhas a medium heat. If over gas, the flame should be low, and\\ncovered with asbestos. Proceed as with the scrambled egg,\\nwith great rapidity, and when the mass is creamy, lift the pan,\\ntip it slightly, and push the whole mass toward the handle end\\nof the pan. Put two teaspoonfuls more of butter in the pan,\\nand set it where the heat is intense. Smooth the mass of egg\\nover the whole surface of the pan that the omelet may become\\nbrown underneath. Shake the pan gently back and forth, lift\\nthe omelet at the edge with a knife to see if the browning is\\naccomplished, take the pan from the fire, fold or roll the omelet\\nfrom the handle end of the pan to the front, and turn it out\\nupon a hot\\nplate.146\\nA method easier for the novice is to accomplish the first\\nstage in a bowl set into a teakettle, beating into the mass as\\nit thickens a teaspoonful of butter, or a tablespoonful of\\ncream. When the mixture is evenly creamy, turn it into the\\nhot buttered pan and proceed as with (1).\\n(2) Light omelet.—This is not a true omelet, but in reality\\na soufflé cooked in a frying pan. It is somewhat insipid in\\nflavor and is not easier to make well than the French omelet.\\nAs commonly served it is apt to be underdone or tough.\\nWith the light omelet, the eggs and whites are separated and\\nthe whites beaten until light and dry. Beat the yolks until\\ncreamy, adding water and salt as in (1). Pour this mixture\\nover the white, and cut and fold the mass. See page 63.\\nPour this into a buttered baking dish and set in a moderate\\noven. The oven should not be more than 300° F. Serve in\\nthe pan.\\nWhen gas is used, the soufflé may be set in the oven with\\nthe flame low, and browned for a moment under the flame\\nturned high.\\nBoth of these omelets may be varied by the addition of\\nchopped parsley or chopped ham, or grated cheese.\\nLaboratory management. When the price of eggs is high, some of\\nthe experiments can be demonstrated by the teacher. Eggs should\\nbe used when the price is at its lowest, even if this interferes\\nwith the logical sequence of lessons.\\nMILK AND MILK PRODUCTS\\nMilk is the natural food of the young mammal, and contains all\\nthe foodstuffs in a form easily assimilable. Starch is not\\npresent, the carbohydrate being found in the form of lactose, or\\nmilk sugar, a sugar differing somewhat from the sugars found in\\nvegetables and fruit (see Chapter X).\\nWhole milk and the milk products, cream, butter, and cheese, are\\nall important food materials among the nations of the western\\nworld; and the manufacture of milk products, such as condensed\\nmilk, butter, and cheese, has\\ndeveloped147\\nlarge industries. While\\nthe Chinese and Japanese are two great peoples who have not\\nutilized milk or any of its products as food for grown people to\\nany extent, yet we are fully justified in counting these foods\\namong the necessities. Nothing can fully take the place of milk\\nin the family dietary.\\nFigure 41 shows how all the foodstuffs are represented in milk.\\nWhen milk first comes from the cow the fat is suspended in tiny,\\ninvisible particles throughout the water, giving the milk its\\nyellow tint, and the fat rises to the top in the form of cream\\nafter a few hours. The protein, sugar, and ash are dissolved in\\nthe water. When milk reaches the stomach, the protein separates\\nfrom the water in the form of curd. This change is brought about\\nby an enzyme (soluble ferment) called rennin, which is present,\\nalong with pepsin, in the gastric juice. Curd is also formed by\\nthe souring of milk through the action of bacteria, or by adding\\nacid directly to the milk. Milk should never be gulped down, but\\ntaken in sips, so that only small portions of curd are formed in\\nthe stomach, because these are much easier to digest than large\\nones. Sometimes milk is soured purposely, as in buttermilk or\\nzoolak or matzoon, that curds may form and be beaten fine before\\nit is drunk. This is very easy to digest, because then no large\\ncurds can form. For the same reason, it is often better to take\\nmilk with bread or some other food, or to cook it in some dish.\\nSkim milk is a valuable food, for it has everything found in\\nwhole milk but the fat. We miss the flavor of the fat in\\ndrinking it, hence it is better to use it in pudding or soup or\\nin cooking cereals where we do not care so much about the milk\\nflavor. Study Fig. 41, comparing the percentages of the\\nfoodstuffs in whole, skim, and buttermilk, and cream. Notice\\nthat the skim milk is higher than the whole milk in protein and\\nsugar, that it has as much ash, and a trace of fat even. It does\\nnot tell us, however,\\nthat149\\nthe forms of ash in milk are most\\nvaluable, and that it is richer in calcium than any other food\\nmaterial. How these foods compare in fuel value is shown in Fig.\\n42.',\n",

       " 'Wholesome and clean milk.—At present, the milk supply is one of\\nour most pressing community problems, showing how closely the\\ncountry and the city are united. A case of typhoid fever in one\\nfarm family, not properly cared for, may be the seed of a\\nserious epidemic in some town. To insure clean milk to the\\nconsumer, and a fair return in money to the producer, is a great\\nsanitary and commercial problem, not to be solved in a day.\\nMilk is a medium in which bacteria flourish, both the harmless\\nand the disease producing. Typhoid fever and other fatal\\ndiseases may be carried by milk from unclean\\nbarns150\\nand dairies,\\nand tuberculosis is possible from diseased cows. The cows must\\nbe in good health, and the stable clean. Figure 43 shows a\\nstable with cement floor and good drainage. The cows must\\nthemselves be clean, and should be curried and washed. The\\nmilkers should have clean clothes and hands, and all receptacles\\nshould be sterilized. The milk must be rapidly cooled (see Fig.\\n44), bottled in sterilized bottles, kept cool during\\ntransportation, and delivered as promptly as possible to the\\nconsumer. “Certified” milk is produced and handled under the\\nbest conditions, but costs at least 15 cents a quart. Since a\\nquart of milk is equivalent to a pound of steak or to 8 eggs,\\nmilk even at 15 to 20 cents a quart is more economical than meat\\nand eggs at ordinary prices. At the usual price of 8 to 10 cents\\na quart, milk is very economical as compared with other\\nperishable foods.',\n",

       " 'The question of preservation and pasteurization can be treated\\nhere but briefly. Preservatives are forbidden by law in most\\nstates. Pasteurization is heating at a\\ntemperature151\\nsufficiently\\nhigh to kill any disease germs present, but not high enough to\\ngive a cooked taste. This process, while it destroys most of the\\nbacteria, does not kill the spores of all. The chief arguments\\nagainst pasteurization are (1) that on a commercial scale it is\\ndifficult to really accomplish this, and (2) that it is easily\\nused to cover the sale of unclean milk. The argument for it is,\\nthat it is impossible to obtain as yet an ideal supply for a\\nlarge city in hot weather, and that pasteurization, if properly\\nconducted, kills nearly all of the dangerous bacteria and saves\\nthe lives of many babies. Clean milk that needs no\\npasteurization is our ultimate aim, and we must remember that\\nmilk pasteurized under unknown conditions needs to be kept cold\\nand treated with even more care than fresh milk, for it “spoils”\\nquite as easily, only we may not know it because it may not\\ntaste sour.\\nIn the last few years the question of pasteurization\\nhas152\\nbeen\\nstudied with very great care. It is found best to heat the milk\\nfor 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 140° to 155° F. If it\\nis certain that this method has been used, one need not hesitate\\nto trust the milk, for the arguments against pasteurization do\\nnot properly apply here.\\nHow to buy.—Investigate by question and inspection, if\\npossible, the available milk supply. Be sure to do this in the\\ncountry in the summer. Always buy bottled milk. Where the income\\nis small, good quality milk should be used for the little\\nchildren and invalids, and skim milk purchased for cooking. In\\nmany places skim milk is supplied in bottles by reliable firms.\\nThe usual price for bottled milk in the city is 8 to 10 cents,\\nand this is of good average quality. Keep milk cold. If there is\\nno ice, use an ice substitute (page 74), and in very hot weather\\npasteurize or scald the milk, cooling afterward as quickly as\\npossible by placing in cold water and stirring the water.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " 'Principles of cookery.—Clean, sweet milk is an ideal food,\\nwhich requires no cooking. Heating milk to 212° F. changes its\\nproperties in some way, so that it is not considered an ideal\\nfood for babies’ regular diet. If it must be used, for reasons\\nof safety, some uncooked food, such as orange juice, should also\\nbe given. This is the reason for pasteurizing milk instead of\\nboiling it.\\nHeating milk in an open vessel causes some of the protein to\\nharden into a thin “skin” on the top. This can be prevented by\\nstirring the milk until it is cool.\\n1. To pasteurize milk.\\nThis cannot be done accurately without\\na thermometer. The milk bottle should be placed upon a\\nrack in a kettle of water, with a clean thermometer inserted\\nthrough the cover of the bottle. Heat the water slowly,\\nand watch the thermometer. When it reaches 155° F., see that\\nthe water becomes no hotter. Set the kettle on a rack\\non153\\nthe stove top, or use a simmering burner with rack and asbestos\\nmat. It is difficult to keep the temperature even, but\\nit should remain at 140-155° F. half an hour. At the end of\\nhalf an hour, the bottle should be removed, and cooled as\\nrapidly as possible in running cold water.\\n2. Rennet custard.\\n1 quart milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar,\\na shake of salt, flavoring, 1 rennet tablet. The flavoring\\nmay be: 1 teaspoonful vanilla, or a few tablespoonfuls of\\norange juice, or the vanilla, plus three or four tablespoonfuls of\\ncocoa to suit the taste.\\nTo prepare.—This is a process without cooking. Rennet\\ntablets are made from the stomach of the calf, and contain the\\ndigestive enzyme, rennin, which results in the solidifying of the\\ncurd of the milk. Rennet custard has passed the first stage of\\nmilk digestion.\\nPut all the flavoring substances into the milk, and warm it\\nslightly, not more than 100° F. The cocoa when used should\\nbe “dissolved” in a small amount of hot water. Dissolve\\nthe rennet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and stir this very\\nthoroughly into the milk. Pour the milk into the cups in which\\nthe custard will be served, and set the cups in a warm but not\\nhot place. A good method is to place them in a pan of warm\\nwater (100° F.). The milk becomes firm in a half hour or an\\nhour, and as soon as it is set, should be put in the ice box, otherwise\\nthe process continues and the custard becomes watery\\nas the curd shrinks and forces out the whey. Serve very cold\\nwith fruit on the top, or whipped cream with the cocoa flavoring;\\nor put grated nutmeg or powdered cinnamon on the top.\\nThis is a simple and delicious dessert, and one of the most wholesome.\\nFor children it should be flavored with fruit juice or\\nvanilla rather than with cocoa.\\n3. Uses of sour milk.\\nDo not throw away any sour milk that is\\nclean and not stale. Milk that has soured enough to set, is a\\ndelicious dessert, with cream and sugar. The acid is very pleasant,\\nbeing the same as that of buttermilk. Sour milk is better for\\ngriddlecakes and muffins than sweet milk. (See Chapter XI.)\\nAnother excellent use for sour milk is to make it into cottage\\ncheese. (See below.)\\n154\\nMatzoon and other similar preparations are essentially soured milks,\\nprepared under controlled conditions. These preparations are the common\\nform of milk in certain parts of the Orient, where milk is never used\\nsweet.\\nKumyss is milk slightly soured and fermented with one species of yeast.\\nThis is a Russian method. These preparations are excellent for invalids\\nand exhausted people, for they can sometimes be assimilated because of the\\nfine curds when sweet milk cannot.\\nCondensed milk is a practical method of preserving milk. The milk is\\nevaporated under pressure at a high temperature in apparatus constructed\\nfor the purpose. Cane sugar or glucose is sometimes added. A new patent\\nprocess condenses the milk at low temperature, preserving it for a short\\nperiod, as compared with the condensed milk in tins, but it keeps well for\\nseveral days, and bears transportation. Condensed milk may be used in\\ncooking, when clean fresh milk is not available. The unsweetened kinds are\\nmost useful, but, like pasteurized milk, must be treated with care after\\nthe cans are opened.\\nCheese.—Cheese is made from the curd of milk, and contains the most\\nnutritive parts of the milk in highly concentrated form. In the process of\\nmanufacture, the milk is first curdled by rennet, and the whey strained\\nout. The curds after preliminary treatment, varying according to the style\\nof cheese to be made, are finally pressed together very slowly in a cheese\\npress, which is screwed down more tightly as the cheese becomes dryer. The\\ncheeses are then covered with cheesecloth and “ripened” slowly, the\\nripening process giving characteristic consistency and flavor. This\\nripening is due to the action of bacteria and molds. (See page 97.)\\nForeign varieties of cheese, made originally in some one locality, have\\nmarked colors, quality, and flavors, as\\nBrie,155\\nCamembert, Roquefort, and\\nthe Swiss cheeses. Parmesan is an Italian cheese, excellent with macaroni\\nand spaghetti.\\nAmerican cheeses vary in color, in strength of flavor, in creaminess,\\nand in degree of hardness. Much the greater part is, however, of the\\ngeneral type known as “American cheddar” or “standard factory” cheese.\\nClub cheese is an American cheese of good quality, put up in small jars.\\nIt is a soft cheese, excellent to serve with crackers, but is too\\nexpensive for common use.\\nCottage cheese is a home product made from sour milk, and used at once.\\nComposition and nutritive value.—Cheese is high in protein, and usually\\nin fat. (See Fig. 40.) Note the small amount of water, which makes cheese\\na very concentrated food. The protein content makes it a meat substitute,\\nfor those with whom cheese does not disagree. Being a dense as well as\\nconcentrated form of food,\\nit156\\nshould be eaten in small quantities, and in\\ncombination with other food materials in such a way that it will become\\nfinely divided, or it will not be easily digested. The ash content is\\nhigh, the most valuable of the ash constituents of the milk being retained\\nin the cheese.\\nThe cost of cheese.—The foreign cheeses are expensive, but American\\ncheeses may be classed among the moderate priced foods and they compare\\nfavorably with other protein foods.\\nCheese costs more than beans, and less than most cuts of meat. A good\\nAmerican cheese costs about twenty-five cents per pound. Taking account of\\ncomposition as well as cost per pound, we find that a given amount of\\nmoney buys about twice as much food value when spent for cheese as it\\nwould if spent for beef.

Add the seasoning and other ingredients\\nto the curd, shape in balls, and chill before serving. It\\nis delicious served with lettuce and dressing as a salad, or with\\ngingerbread for dessert at luncheon or supper.\\nPrinciples of cooking cheese.—The fat in the cheese is melted by\\nheat. The protein is toughened by a high temperature, therefore\\na low temperature process should be used.\\n3. Cheese cooked with other food materials.—A creamy cheese\\nshould be selected for cooking. Cheese may be grated and\\nsprinkled on the top of potato on the half shell, or any\\nother mashed potato; or it may be sliced and placed with each\\nlayer in escalloped potato. Its use is common with macaroni;\\nand a dish of macaroni with milk and cheese is a good meat\\nsubstitute, and may be used as the main dish of a luncheon or\\nsimple dinner. Those to whom cheese is agreeable will find\\nmany places for its use. Its flavor harmonizes with celery and\\nwith tomato. The Italians serve grated Parmesan cheese with\\nsoup, and with spaghetti that has a tomato sauce.\\n4. Cheese crackers.—Select crackers of a firm quality that will\\nnot crumble or flake easily, and of a small size. Spread very\\nthinly with soft butter, put the crackers in a pan, and\\nsprinkle grated cheese upon each one. Set the pan in a moderate\\noven until the cheese is melted.

       " '158\\nCHAPTER X\\nTHE FATS AND THE SUGARS\\nFats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but have much more\\ncarbon than the other kinds of foodstuffs. Notice in Fig. 46 that olive\\noil and lard are pure fats; the other fat foods containing water, protein,\\nand ash. Fat is available in various forms, with differing flavors and a\\nwide range of prices. To many people it is unpalatable in some of its\\ncheapest forms; yet its use is important, and some kind should be included\\nin the diet. Fluid and emulsified fats are the most easily digested, hence\\nolive oil, cream, and egg yolk are highly desirable. Bacon and butter\\nbelong nearly in the same class. A vigorous man at hard labor can digest\\nfat of any kind without difficulty, and needs it because it gives so much\\nfuel in proportion to its bulk.\\nFat tends to retard gastric digestion, and delicate persons must be\\ncareful about taking with it other foods which are hard to digest, or\\ntaking it in the form of fried foods, pastries, rich cakes, and sauces.\\nPersons with delicate appetite, who lose weight because they do not get\\nenough fuel, may be benefited by taking a little more fat in the diet,\\nespecially if they do not digest starch and sugar readily, but a very\\nlarge amount (over 6 or 7 ounces a day) will not be perfectly digested.\\nFat as a food.—Beef fat, as it occurs with lean, is a digestible fat.\\nIf thoroughly browned in the cooking process, it is most palatable, and\\nthe taste for it should be cultivated. In gravy, it may be used with\\npotato, instead of butter. Fat tried out from suet,\\nmay161\\nbe used in place\\nof butter as an ingredient in some puddings, and even in batter mixtures.\\nIt may also be used with vegetables when the price of butter is\\nprohibitive.

       " 'Bacon is a digestible and agreeable form of fat, but it is not so cheap\\nas beef fat, though cheaper than butter.\\nFat pork is lower in price than bacon, and can be assimilated by\\nvigorous people, especially those living out of doors.\\nCream is one of the most delicious fatty food materials, and is\\ndigestible, but ranks with butter and bacon as to cost. While it is not a\\ncheap food, it is not such an extravagance when moderately used as some\\npeople suppose, who have not worked out the problem. Usually the most\\neconomical source of cream is to take it from the top of the bottle of\\nmilk. The remaining partially skimmed milk may be used at table or in\\ncooking or for making cottage cheese.\\nButter is a digestible fat, ranking at present among the more expensive\\nfood materials.\\nWatchfulness is necessary with both cream and milk that cleanliness and\\nquality may be insured.\\nButter substitutes.—These are made from beef fat and other edible fats\\nand oils, and are much less expensive than butter. They may be used in\\ncooking with good result. The usual trade names are butterine, or\\noleomargarine, or some word similar to these. Oleomargarine has the same\\nfood value as butter at lower cost, but lacks fine flavor.\\nOlive or sweet oil.—The fat content of olive oil is one hundred per\\ncent, its fuel value being equal to that of lard. See Fig. 46. It is made\\nin Italy, France, Spain, and California, the oils from the different\\ncountries differing somewhat in flavor. The cheaper grades are sometimes\\nadulterated with corn oil or cottonseed oil, which have the same food\\nvalue but should, of course, be sold under their own names and not at\\nolive oil prices. An American firm is now manufacturing olive oil in\\nSpain; this and the California olive oil are of high grade. Italian oil by\\nthe gallon is of good quality, and usually somewhat less expensive than\\nthe French. It is a costly food material, but valuable in the dietary.\\nNever buy it in small bottles, as this adds greatly to the cost. The most\\neconomical method is to purchase by the gallon in a tin can.

       " '162\\nFat as a cooking medium.—Fat is necessary for the sauté, and for deep fat\\nfrying. For deep fat frying several preparations are made from cottonseed\\noil that are agreeable to use and of moderate price.\\nLard has been the most commonly used, but many people object to the\\nflavor. Beef drippings should be saved and kept cool in covered jelly\\nglasses. These drippings are useful for browning vegetables, meatballs,\\nand in pan-broiling if a small amount of additional fat is necessary.\\nWhen deep fat frying is used, great pains must be taken to see that the\\nfat is sufficiently hot in order that the food material may not soak fat,\\nand the cooked food must be kept hot when the fat is draining off on\\nabsorptive paper. The best fats for this purpose are the vegetable oils.\\nThe refined cottonseed oils now on the market are excellent. For details\\nof use see page 120. Keep a box of sand to pour into it, if the kettle of\\nfat takes fire. Never pour water into blazing fat.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " 'Principles of cooking.\\nFat melts at a low temperature.\\nAt about 350° F. it begins to smoke.\\nAt a higher temperature, a chemical change takes place, and the\\nfat finally “burns,” as the hydrogen and oxygen pass off.\\nIt is emulsified by mixing with a substance like egg.\\n1. To whip cream.—Chill the cream, and set it in a bowl of ice\\nwater, or chipped ice. If the cream is warm, the beating will\\nchurn the cream to butter.\\n(1) For a fine, close-whipped cream use a Dover egg beater.\\n(2) For a lighter whipped cream, use a wire beater.\\n2. To mold butter.—A pair of wooden butter pats is necessary\\nfor this. Dip these first into hot water, then into cold. Cut\\noff a square piece of butter, enough for one person, make it\\nflat or round with two knives, and then roll it into shape\\nbetween the butter pats. Chill, and serve in a dish on\\nice;163\\nor give one to each person on a butter plate, just at the last\\nmoment before serving the meal. Never serve soft butter.\\n3. To cook bacon.—Bacon has alternate layers of fat and lean,\\nbut it is the fat that has chief consideration in the cooking\\nprocess. The aim is to brown and crisp the fat without\\nburning it and without causing a volume of smoke in the\\nkitchen. Make ready a frying pan, and have at hand a jar\\nfor holding fat standing on a plate. Cut the bacon in thin\\nslices with a sharp knife. Heat the pan, and put in the bacon.\\nThe fat will begin to “try out” at the melting point. Pour\\nthis melted fat into the jar. Turn the pieces of bacon with a fork.\\nIf the smoke is rising in volumes the pan is too hot. The\\nnovice should not try this experiment for the first time by herself.\\nThe fat may even burst into flame if the pan is too hot.\\nWhen the bacon is sufficiently cooked to become crisp on cooling,\\nit is ready to serve, by itself, with toast, or with eggs.\\nThe making of sauces and gravies.—Many sauces and gravies are made from a\\nfat, mixed with a starchy substance, the two mingled with a liquid. The\\nfat gives flavor and nutriment, the starch is used for thickening, the\\nliquid also gives flavor. You are now familiar with the cooking of fat and\\nstarch, and can readily understand that the combination of all these\\ningredients is not an easy matter. The fat will float upon the top of the\\nliquid unless the right amount of starch or flour is used, and the flour\\nwill have a tendency to lump. There are several good methods in use. The\\nmethod given for your experiment is one of the simplest, because it uses\\nonly a few utensils, and gives uniformly good results.

A brown sauce or meat gravy may be made in the same way, using\\nbeef fat, and (as the liquid) water that has been poured into\\nthe pan in which the meat is cooked. When you are familiar\\nwith cooking there is an easier way for thickened meat gravies,\\nas follows:\\nPour off some of the fat from the meat pan. Set the pan\\nupon the stove and stir in the flour,—about two tablespoonfuls\\nfor the ordinary roasting pan. When the flour is thoroughly\\nmixed in, add about a pint of water, cold or warm, and stir\\nagain. Pour this mixture through a strainer. With practice\\nyou can make an excellent gravy in this way.

       " '171\\nCHAPTER XI\\nMUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY\\nWheat flour is the important material in this group, but muffins and\\nbiscuit may be varied by the use of corn meal, rye, and Graham flour, and\\ncooked cereals may also be utilized. The ingredients are flour, salt, a\\nliquid, sometimes a fat, eggs, and sugar. The flavorings are spices,\\nessences, fruit juice, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate. The mixture must be\\nsmooth, but it is also necessary to make it porous or “light.” This is\\naccomplished by means of leavening agents, “to leaven” meaning “to make\\nlight.”\\nLeavening agents.—The batter, or dough, is leavened by introducing into\\nit air or a gas that expands when heated in the oven, thus making the\\nwhole more porous and larger in bulk.',\n",
       " 'Air.—This is introduced into the batter by beating, or by\\nbeating air into the white of egg and stirring the beaten white\\ninto the batter.\\nSteam.—The water in the batter turns to steam in the oven,\\nand as it expands it assists in the leavening of the mass. See\\nPopovers.\\nCarbon dioxide gas.—This is introduced in three ways.',\n",
       " '(1) By using an acid with a carbonate.\\n(2) By yeast fermentation.\\n(3) By machinery.',\n",
       " 'Yeast fermentation is studied in the chapter on bread making\\n(Chapter XII), and the mechanical method is a commercial process\\nexclusively. Only the first method will be treated in this\\nchapter.\\nWhen an acid and any alkaline carbonate are dissolved\\ntogether,172\\na chemical action takes place, a gas is given off (carbon\\ndioxide) and another substance is formed that is neutral, being\\nneither acid nor alkaline, and known as a “salt.” In selecting\\nthe two substances we must bear in mind this neutral substance\\nthat remains in the batter and insure its harmlessness.\\nThe lactic acid of sour milk is probably the earliest used,\\nbeing a domestic product. The lactic acid is neutralized by\\nbicarbonate of sodium, the latter being also called “baking\\nsoda.” The resulting salt is harmless.\\nAcid molasses with soda is another old-fashioned method. Here\\nthe acid is developed by the fermentation of the molasses.\\nCream of tartar (acid potassium tartrate), obtained from\\ncrystals deposited in wine vats, came into use later,\\nneutralized by bicarbonate of soda, two parts of cream of tartar\\nto one of soda.\\nBaking powder.—The first baking powders were made of cream of\\ntartar and bicarbonate of soda, mixed with a starch, to prevent\\nthe slight chemical action which would cause the powder to lose\\nstrength; and these two substances are now used in the best\\nbaking powders. The resulting salt is the Rochelle salt of\\nmedicine.\\nAn acid phosphate is sometimes used with soda, and this gives\\na harmless neutral substance.\\nCheaper acids have sometimes been used, especially alum. It is\\nbest not to use an alum powder. Select a standard kind, avoiding\\nthose that offer prizes for a certain number of boxes purchased.\\nEven if these latter do not contain alum, there is probably an\\nexcess of starch or flour.\\nThe advantage of baking powder is in the accuracy of the\\nproportions of the two substances by weight. Even though the\\nmeasuring of the cream of tartar and soda separately is\\naccurate, the proportions may not be correct. There is no great\\nadvantage in homemade baking powder. It costs almost as much as\\nthe manufactured, and is not as perfect a product.\\nThe proportions of the main ingredients.—Attempts are made to define the\\ndegrees of stiffness of batters and doughs, but these distinctions are not\\nvery accurate. A “pour batter” is liquid enough to pour, and a “dough\\nbatter” soft enough to drop from a spoon; a “soft dough” is next in grade,\\nand “dough” is the stiffest of all.',\n",
       " '173\\nTo understand proportioning the ingredients, the nature of the ingredients\\nwhen heated must be taken into account. Butter and other fats melt when\\nheated, and behave like a liquid in the mixture. Therefore, when there is\\na very large amount of butter, no other wetting is necessary, as in pound\\ncake. We may make a scale, with a thin popover mixture at one extreme,\\nwith no butter in it, and the stiff pound cake at the other, with butter\\nthe only liquid (except the flavoring). Between these two are the mixtures\\nof medium stiffness, with both butter and liquid. This general rule may be\\ngiven: As the quantity of butter is increased, the batter must increase in\\nstiffness, and there must be either less liquid or more flour.\\nA beaten egg looks like a liquid and behaves so during the mixing, but in\\nthe oven it stiffens. For this reason we can make a sponge cake with many\\neggs and no liquid in the mixing, and use no other leavening agent than\\nthe air beaten into the egg.\\nOne old-fashioned rule for sponge cake reads: Take the weight of the eggs\\nin sugar and half their weight in flour, with the juice and rind of a\\nlemon for ten eggs. Such a rule was adapted to the days when eggs were\\ncheap. We should now use fewer eggs in sponge cake, and this means that\\nwater and baking powder must replace the eggs omitted.',\n",

An oven that is too hot\\nmay be cooled by a pan of water. Paper may be laid over the top of the\\ncake if the browning has been too rapid.

       " '187\\nCHAPTER XII\\nYEAST BREAD\\nYeast bread when well made is a food of which the palate never tires, and\\nit is usually recognized as a part of every well-planned meal. The quick\\nbreads are a convenient substitute at times, but they are not the staff of\\nlife in the same sense, and are, on the whole, less widely used.\\nThe making of a perfect loaf of bread is the goal of all those who aspire\\nto excel in cookery; and the art of bread making requires not only a clear\\nunderstanding of the underlying principles, but patience and persistence\\nin experimentation and practice until a uniformly perfect product is\\nachieved. The fact that in yeast we have a living organism with which to\\ndeal makes the whole process a delicate one, in which every detail is of\\nimportance, whether it be a matter of ingredients, proportions, methods of\\nmixing, or temperature.\\nThe standard of good bread.—There will always be some difference of\\nopinion in regard to a desirable quality in bread, and individual\\npreference will control the final result, whether the crumb of the bread\\nshall be dry and porous or somewhat more moist and finer in grain. French\\nbread is of the former type, the English preferring a close grain and\\nsolid loaf. Allowing for these differences, it is still possible to\\nstandardize bread, and to state in percentages the different points to be\\nconsidered in judging a loaf.\\nWe must consider the size and symmetry of the loaf, in order that the\\ninterior of the bread may be baked to the\\nvery188\\ncenter, without overbaking\\nor burning the crust, and therefore very large loaves should be avoided.\\nThe crust should be uniform in color, the shade ranging from a light\\ngolden to a darker brown, and the quality may be soft or crisp, but never\\ntough. The crumb should be light, the cavities evenly distributed\\nthroughout the loaf and of uniform size. It should also be elastic,\\ntender, and yet not pasty, evenly baked without streaks and heavy portions\\nnear the crust, and the color should be creamy rather than a snowy white.\\n(Fig. 55.)\\nThe following score cards will be useful in judging loaves, and in the\\nbread contests which are interesting and helpful.\\nBREAD SCORE CARD 1',\n",

       " 'Like the cereals, it has considerable protein, and some fat, but is\\nhighest in starch. The white bread, unless made with milk, has very little\\nash. A slice almost one inch thick weighing 1.38 ounces, from a baker’s\\nfive-cent loaf, will yield 100 Calories.\\nThe cost of bread.—The table in Chapter XVII states the amount of protein\\nand energy obtained for ten cents from bread as compared with other common\\nfoods, and makes the fact clear that bread is essentially one of the\\ncheapest foods, remaining relatively so whatever the general fluctuations\\nin food prices may be.\\nA pound loaf of bread at the bakery should cost five cents, the cost being\\nslightly less when the bread is made at home, even taking the fuel into\\naccount. It is an open question, however, whether bread should be made at\\nhome or bought at the bakery, all the circumstances being weighed in the\\nbalance by the individual. (See Chapter XVII.) In America, we need to\\nlearn to dictate and control the methods in\\nthe191\\npublic bakeries because\\nbakers’ bread is being used more and more, although it is said that 50 per\\ncent is still made at home. If bread is to be bought, it is necessary for\\nthe housekeeper to understand the bread-making process and the standard of\\ngood bread that she may criticize intelligently, and force the public\\nbakeries to furnish bread made under ideal conditions. Such bread is\\nsupplied in France, where the housekeepers in the city, though noted for\\ntheir thrift, do not think of bread making at home as a practical or\\neconomical procedure. It must be understood that the baker’s oven is\\nfitted to do better work than the small oven of the average kitchen, and\\nif the public through laws and inspection will control the quality of the\\nmaterials used and the cleanliness of the process, baker’s bread will be a\\nuseful “ready-cooked” food.\\nThe ingredients of bread.—The essential ingredients are flour, water, and\\nyeast. The liquid may be milk, or milk and water, the milk changing the\\nflavor slightly and increasing the nutritive value, while the cream in the\\nmilk increases the tenderness of the crumb and crust. The non-essentials\\ninclude salt to develop flavor, sugar sometimes added to hasten\\nfermentation and also for flavor, and a fat to increase tenderness, as,\\nfor instance, butter or some cheaper fat. Spices and dried fruits are used\\nin sweet breads, and when eggs are added sweet bread becomes a plain cake\\nhaving a delicious and characteristic flavor.\\nThe characteristics of good flour.—The average composition of flour is as\\nfollows:',\n",

The protein of oats and corn lacks this property, and therefore\\noatmeal and corn meal give a very different type of bread. Rye flour\\ncontains gluten, and the rye loaf therefore resembles the wheat loaf.\\nWheat and flour differ largely on account of the difference in the amount\\nof gluten, and the gluten itself varies in quality with the variety of\\nwheat.',\n",

Again, the same variety of wheat will differ from season to\\nseason,193\\nand the time of planting, also, affects the quality of the grain.\\nThe time of planting and reaping gives us two classes of wheat and flour,\\nthe winter and spring. Winter wheat is sown in the fall and obtains its\\nfirst growth before winter, living through the winter in those latitudes\\nwhere the climate is sufficiently mild, being harvested in early summer.\\nSpring wheat is sown in the spring and harvested late and it is the wheat\\nof the great flour-producing state, Minnesota.

       " 'Note that the spring wheat contains more protein and therefore more\\ngluten. The flour from spring wheat is creamy in color, granular to the\\ntouch, has more gluten, and is known as a strong flour. Flour from\\nwinter wheat is somewhat whiter in color and smoother to the touch,\\nfeeling more like cornstarch, and if a portion is squeezed in the hand, it\\nretains the imprint of the fingers. It has less gluten, more starch, and\\nis known as a soft flour. This type of flour is sometimes called “pastry\\nflour,” the smaller percentage of gluten making it more desirable for\\npastry or cake than the stronger flour.\\nFlour manufacturers and bakers are constantly experimenting to find the\\nbest possible varieties and combinations of varieties for bread flour.\\nSome difference of opinion\\nexists,194\\nbut a combination of winter and spring\\nwheat in flour is considered the best for bread by some authorities.\\nWe must learn to like a creamy color in bread, for this means the presence\\nof more gluten. To summarize: a good bread flour contains a large\\npercentage of gluten, is creamy in color, and granular to the touch.\\nManufacture of flour.—Modern machinery has taken the place of the\\nold-time stones in the grinding of flour, although the two main divisions\\nof the process remain the same, these being the crushing of the grain and\\nthe sifting out of the coarse portion. Milling now includes many stages in\\nthe process not possible with the cruder machinery of former times, and\\nthe present effects a greater number of separations and permits the miller\\nto make a greater variety of products.',\n",

The\\nmilling process must remove the bran coats and the germ, and crush and\\nroll the remaining portions to the necessary fineness. The germ if allowed\\nto remain affects the color and keeping properties. The breaking and\\nrolling are accomplished by steel machinery, and the final sifting is done\\nthrough silk bolting cloth.\\nBy195\\nthe new machinery about 70 per cent of the\\nwheat is saved for food, 30 per cent being bran, “shorts,” and other\\nby-products used chiefly for cattle feeding.\\nFigure 54 shows the vertical section of a mill, simplified in the drawing\\nthat all the steps of the process may be clear.

       " 'The typical parts in a modern flour mill are as follows: (1) Scales, for\\nweighing wheat as it is received. (2) Receiving separator, for separating\\nother kinds of seeds from wheat. (3) Storage bins, for reserve supply of\\nwheat in advance of mill requirements. (4) Mill separator, for further\\nseparating foreign seeds from wheat. (5) Scourer, for removing dust from\\nwheat kernels. (6) Cockle cylinder, for removing all round seeds. (7)\\nWheat washer, for thoroughly cleansing the wheat. (8) Wheat dryer, for\\ndrying wheat after washing. (9) 1st break rolls, for rupturing bran,\\nenabling bran and germ to be separated from interior.

(23) Flour bin and\\npacker, for packing flour for shipment. (24) Elevator, for raising\\nproducts to the various machines.\\nOther forms of flour.—There has been much discussion of entire wheat\\nflour versus white flour, and the practical conclusions are as follows:\\nthe bread from whole wheat flour compares favorably with that from white\\nflour (see Fig. 51), but this material is slightly less available for\\ndigestion than the material of the white flour. The mineral content is\\nhigher, and when the income is so limited that this cannot be furnished in\\nmilk, green vegetables, and fruit, whole wheat bread should be used. It\\nmakes a pleasing variety, too, for any table.\\nGraham flour is a coarse flour, containing the outer bran. It is useful\\nfor its effect upon the intestines in case of constipation, but has to be\\navoided by some people on account of its irritating effect. White flour\\nmay have coarser material mixed with it, for variety in bread making, such\\nas rye or Indian meal, or graham flour.\\nYeast in bread.—Yeast is put into bread dough in order to produce carbon\\ndioxide gas to lighten the whole mass. It is studied in the chapter on\\npreservation of fruit, but in bread making we need to foster its growth\\ninstead of destroying it as, you will recall, we found necessary in\\npreserving. You can easily reason out for yourself just how this should be\\ndone, especially after performing the experiments with yeast.\\nIf yeast is in good condition, it has little effect on the flavor of\\nbread, even if used in a rather large quantity to hasten the process.\\nThe best forms of yeast now in use are the compressed and dried cakes, the\\nformer needing to be fresh, the\\nlatter198\\nkeeping the vitality of the yeast\\ncells for a long time. Liquid yeast may be made at home, but it is\\nsomewhat uncertain unless made with great exactness, and less easy to\\nmanage on the whole than the other forms.\\nProportions of the ingredients.—One part of water to three of flour, or\\none cup to three of flour for a loaf, is an average proportion. The\\npracticed bread maker will vary this slightly to suit the variations in\\nthe flour from time to time, but it is a safe rule for the beginner to\\nfollow. Spring wheat flour requires somewhat more water than the winter\\nwheat, or the blend of the two. Salt should be used sparingly, for\\nalthough it improves the flavor of the loaf, salt is a preservative which\\nretards or prevents the growth of lower organisms, and in the case of\\nbread it acts therefore as a check to fermentation. One teaspoonful to a\\nloaf is the largest amount that it is best to use.\\nThe quantity of yeast depends upon several conditions. The larger the\\namount of yeast used, the shorter is the time of rising, and as many as\\ntwo compressed yeast cakes may be used to one loaf if it is necessary to\\nhasten the process, without any perceptible effect on the color, texture\\nor flavor. If a very large amount of yeast is used, the bread is\\n“crumbly,” and a difference in flavor will be noticed. A smaller amount\\nmay be used if time is allowed for the rising, even 1⁄8 cake of compressed\\nyeast to a loaf, if the bread is to rise over night in warm weather. It\\nmust be remembered that, if the rising process is too prolonged, other\\norganisms have a chance to work, and the bread may sour.\\nA small amount of sugar hastens fermentation, and from one to two\\nteaspoonfuls to a loaf may be used. Many people prefer the flavor of bread\\nwith no sugar, however. Some bakers use malt extract both as a yeast food\\nto hasten fermentation and for its effect upon the flavor.',\n",
       " '200\\nFat, or shortening, should be sparingly used, not more than one or two\\nteaspoonfuls being allowed to a loaf. If you study a number of bread\\nrecipes, you will see that this ingredient varies more than the others. As\\na matter of fact, if the flour is of good quality and the bread well made,\\nthis ingredient is not necessary (in loaf bread at least), although it\\nseems to improve the quality of biscuit and rolls.\\nMethods of mixing and the rising of bread.—Dissolve the yeast in a\\nportion of the liquid, stir this mixture into the remaining liquid, add\\nhalf the flour, and beat the mixture thoroughly at this stage. Add the\\nsugar if any is to be used. When this soft mixture, called the “sponge,”\\nbecomes full of bubbles, add the salt, the shortening if used, and the\\nremaining flour. Knead the dough by the hand, or by the machine, for about\\nten minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Put it into a greased\\nbowl, cover the bowl, and allow the dough to remain until it doubles its\\nbulk. Some bread makers knead in all the flour at the first, and obtain a\\ngood result. The first rising is more rapid, however, and experience seems\\nto prove that the results are better on the whole with the sponge. Cut the\\ndough down, knead again, using as little flour as possible. Shape into\\nloaves, place the loaves in greased pans, cover, and leave again until the\\nloaves double their bulk, when they are ready for baking. If left too\\nlong, the bubbles of gas become too large.\\nTemperature and time are important, in this matter of mixing and\\nrising. The process may be shortened to five or six hours, including the\\nbaking, or lengthened to twenty-four by the choice of the amount of yeast\\nand the temperature. The shorter process is the better, on the whole.\\nAfter reading over the sections of the chapter on preservation of fruit,\\nperforming the yeast experiments, and discussing the results, you will be\\nable to answer these questions:',\n",

What temperature will you secure for the bread while it is\\nrising?\\n4. If an emergency occurs, and the dough cannot be kneaded or\\nbaked at the moment it is ready, what can be done? Can you think\\nof two expedients?\\nA few suggestions.—The kneading stretches the gluten and long kneading\\ngives a fine grain. In such a recipe as that for the making of Parker\\nHouse rolls, a very delicate quality results from a protracted process;\\none old-fashioned housekeeper recommends a half hour’s kneading three\\ntimes. Fortunately a sufficiently good bread or roll may be made by ten or\\nfifteen minutes’ kneading at a time.\\nBread dough may be cut or stirred with a large knife in place of the\\nkneading, and this is a good method to teach to those who live in crowded\\nspace and find it difficult to have a perfectly clean kitchen and proper\\nutensils. With this method the dough must be softer, and it remains in the\\nbowl until it is turned into the baking pan. The resulting loaf is\\nsomewhat moist, and not fine-grained, but the flavor is good.\\nBrushing the surface of the dough in the bowl or pan with water or milk\\nwill prevent the formation of a dry crust on the top.\\nBaking the bread.—The temperature of the oven should be steady, and about\\n380° F.

The sandwich.—The sandwich is a convenient way of serving\\nbread and other foods away from the table, for picnics, teas,\\nand receptions.\\nTo prepare the bread.—Either white or brown bread may\\nbe used. Select a well-shaped loaf of fine grain that will not\\ncrumb when it is sliced. Cut off the end of the loaf, spread\\nthe loaf evenly with butter, cut a thin slice, butter again, and\\nso on. The butter should be softened. Be careful to spread\\nit evenly and see that it is near the edge of the bread. Sandwiches\\nmay be made either with or without the crust. If the\\ncrust is to be removed, cut it off the loaf before buttering and\\nslicing.\\nThe filling.—There is an endless variety of filling possible\\nfor sandwiches, from slices of meat and poultry, which\\nmake a substantial luncheon for picnics, to the dainty fillings\\nused for afternoon teas and receptions. A crisp bit of lettuce\\nleaf with Mayonnaise dressing is always acceptable. Cream\\ncheese mixed with nuts and raisins is a good filling. For a\\nsweet sandwich, jam or jelly may be spread on the slices and\\npossibly a small amount of cream cheese put between. You\\ncan invent many combinations.\\nThe shape of the sandwich may be oblong, triangular, or round.\\nThe round sandwich is cut with a sharp cooky cutter. The\\npieces remaining may be dried and used for bread crumbs.\\nThe crusts may always be utilized in this way.\\n9. Croutons.—Cut a slice of bread a day old 1⁄2 inch thick. Spread\\nwith soft butter, cut off the crust, put the slices in a pan,\\ncut in cubes and set the pan in the oven until the croutons are\\nbrown.\\nEXERCISES\\n1.

       " 'Tough and tender meat.—To understand the difference between the tough and\\ntender cuts we must be familiar with the structure of the muscle (see Fig.\\n57). Each muscle consists of bundles of tubes held together by connective\\ntissue. In tough meat, the muscle tubes are thicker and there is more\\nconnective tissue present. Exercise strengthens the muscle, and this\\naccounts for the fact that the unexercised muscles of the young animal\\ngive us a softer meat. In the mature animal the muscles most exercised\\nfurnish the tough meat, and the less used muscles the tender. If you study\\nFig. 58, you can easily determine where the tough meat will occur, if you\\nthink of the proportionate amount of exercise that the different muscles\\nreceive. The tough cuts come from the neck and legs, the tender cuts from\\nthe\\nmiddle213\\nof the back, the toughness increasing as the cuts approach the\\nneck and the hind legs. The muscles of the abdomen are also tender, but\\nthey give a coarse-grained meat. The various cuts of meat are shown as\\nthey occur in the standing animal in Fig. 58, and in the hind and fore\\nquarters hanging, in Figs. 59 and 60. The individual cuts of beef and\\nmutton are shown in the figures that follow. The tender cuts from the ribs\\nand loin are the most highly prized, and therefore bring the highest\\nprice. These cuts are liked because of their tenderness although the\\nnutritive value of the tough meat is as high or possibly even higher than\\nthat of the tender. All meat is now high-priced, and you will find the\\nreasons for this discussed in Chapter XVII. For the sake of economy we are\\nforced to use the relatively cheaper cuts, and to seek for meat\\nsubstitutes. We must also take pains to use the cooking processes that\\nwill make the tough meats palatable.',\n",

       " 'Composition and nutritive value.—Figure 64 shows you the composition of\\nseveral common meats. Meat is valuable chiefly for its protein, fat, and\\nmineral salts. The juices of the meat in the muscle cells contain\\nnitrogenous extractive materials which give flavor, and are possibly\\nstimulating, but they have no food value. From the bone and also from the\\nconnective tissue, gelatin is dissolved in cooking. Gelatin is a protein,\\nbut differs in certain chemical properties from other proteins, and cannot\\nbe used as the only source of nitrogen. It is a very useful protein,\\nhowever, and as it can be substituted in part for more expensive proteins,\\nit used to be called a “protein saver.”\\nIn spite of the fact that meat is a common article of diet it should not\\nbe used in excess. Other forms of protein, as those in eggs and milk, are\\nusually digested as easily, and most people can digest vegetable proteins\\nif the vegetables are carefully prepared. Very little children should not\\nhave216\\nmeat, for it has stimulating properties which are undesirable for\\nthem, and it takes away the taste for foods more important for growth (see\\nFood for Growth, Chapter XVIII). When used largely in the diet, meat tends\\nto cause intestinal putrefaction and to form excess of acid in the body.\\nIt is less likely to be harmful if taken with plenty of fruits and green\\nvegetables and liberal drinking of clear water.',\n",

The fuel\\nvalue of meat depends largely upon the amount of fat which is eaten.

Government protection\\nmust be given us here, but the housekeeper too has a responsibility. If\\nthe raw meat has failed to receive proper inspection, we can protect\\nourselves by cooking the meat to a degree that will kill any parasite\\npresent. For this reason meat should not be served that looks raw or too\\nunderdone. The cooked meat should be pink rather than red.\\nMeat poisoning may be avoided in the first place by exercising great\\ncare in regard to the odor of meat. Meat may hang to “ripen,” as the\\nbutchers say, but one must learn to distinguish between the odor of\\nproperly ripened meat, and that of even slightly tainted meat. Quite as\\nimportant is the rapid cooling of meat, poultry, fish, and soups that\\nare not to be used at once. Cases of digestive disturbance and even actual\\npoisoning sometimes occur when underdone meat, especially lamb, veal, or\\npoultry, remains warm overnight.',\n",

       " 'The effect of heat upon meat.—The fat of meat is melted by heat. The\\nmeat fiber shrinks and\\nhardens220\\nwith intense heat; on the other hand it\\nsoftens at a temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water. The\\nstructure of the muscle must be studied further in order to make the\\nprinciples of cooking perfectly clear. If you think of the structure of\\nthe muscle cell as somewhat resembling the structure of an orange, you can\\npicture quite clearly what happens under different conditions. Open a\\nsection of orange and separate some of the single cells. These may\\nrepresent the muscle cells of meat that can be seen only under the\\nmicroscope. If you cut across one of these tiny cells, the contents will\\nescape, and this is what happens when the muscle cells are cut across.\\nThen, too, if the muscle is heated, the juices will pass through the\\nmembrane of the cell, and this happens, too, if the meat is put into cold\\nwater. The substances in the juices of the meat which are not coagulated\\nby heat are called the extractives, because they can be extracted by hot\\nwater. The most valuable protein matter remains behind in the muscle cell,\\nhowever. Among these proteins are those known as meat albumin, and this\\nbehaves in cooking very much as does the white of egg,—that is to say, it\\ncoagulates.\\nBearing these facts in mind, we can decide just what to do in order to\\nbring about the result that we desire in meat cookery, for sometimes we\\nwish to extract the juices and sometimes we wish to have all, or nearly\\nall, retained in the meat. We are now ready to state the principles of\\nmeat cookery as follows:\\n1. Juices retained.\\nIn broiling, pan broiling, roasting, and boiling the high temperature\\ncoagulates the meat albumin and hardens the fiber on the surface, thus\\nforming a coating which prevents the further escape of juices. In the\\nroasting and boiling\\nof221\\nlarge pieces the temperature may then be lowered\\nto prevent the further shrinking and hardening of the fiber in the\\ninterior of the meat, which comes from a protracted high temperature. With\\na very thick steak after the surface searing the cooking may be completed\\nin the oven.\\n2. Juices extracted.\\nIn beef juice or beef tea, this may be done by placing the chopped beef in\\na jar and placing the jar in an oven, or in hot water; or for beef tea and\\nordinary soup by putting the chopped meat, or small pieces of meat, in\\ncold water and heating the water slowly.\\n3. Juices partly retained and partly extracted.\\nThis is desirable in stews, in braised beef, and in pot roast. State for\\nyourself just how this would be accomplished.\\n4. Connective tissue softened at low temperature, and with water.\\n5. Sterilization by continued heat which destroys parasites and\\nbacteria.\\n6.

Place steak in the broiler and sear meat\\nfirst on one side, then on the other. Continue to turn the\\nbroiler and cook the meat until it is brown and done according\\nto taste. Steak an inch thick will take about ten minutes to\\nbe cooked to a medium degree. Chops are broiled in the same\\nway.\\n(2) Steak and chops may also be broiled in the pan. An\\niron frying pan is the best utensil. Heat the pan, and brush\\nit over with a small piece of fat cut from the steak or the\\nchops. The purpose of this is merely to keep the meat from\\nsticking to the pan. The principle of procedure is the same as\\nwith (1). The steak or chops must be frequently turned,\\nusing a knife and a fork, being careful not to prick the meat\\nwith the fork. The length of time is slightly longer than\\nfor (1). This method must not be confused with the frying\\nof steak in a pan with a large amount of fat. By this method\\nthe steak is not fried, and it is often a convenient substitute\\nfor (1).\\n2.

The expert soup maker will obtain\\ndelicious flavors by adding bits of many kinds of left overs—almost\\nanything that is found in the refrigerator in the way of\\nfruit, vegetables, and pieces of meat. With the coming of the\\ngas stove, many people have given up soup making. These\\nvarious left overs add much to the flavor of the soup and\\ncan be used in a thickened soup which is like the bouillon\\nstrained and thickened. The thickening may be flour, arrowroot,\\ncold cereal, sago, tapioca, or rice. Spaghetti,\\nvermicelli,224\\nand fancy forms of paste are sometimes served. Vegetables\\nmay be cut into dice or fancy shapes and served in the clear\\nsoup. A great variety is possible in flavoring and serving soup\\nif one will take the trouble to make it an art.\\nSoup meat may be served in a soup of the old-fashioned\\nkind, thickened and containing vegetables. In such a soup some\\nfat is left, and the total result is a dish that makes a meal when\\nserved with bread.\\nWhen the soup is a clear soup, the meat that is left may be\\nused for made over dishes; although some practical housekeepers\\nthink that it costs almost as much to make it palatable\\nas to buy fresh meat.

Notice the odor of the fowl particularly. The skin of cold-storage\\npoultry has not such a good color and is sometimes broken. Often the flesh\\nis shrunken, and if the cold storage has been too long continued the odor\\nis unpleasant. Refrigeration is allowable for a period. Another way to\\njudge cold-storage poultry is\\nby227\\nthe price. Well-fed poultry freshly\\nkilled brings a high market price and a bargain quite often proves to be\\npoultry too long in cold storage. Good quality poultry is at present a\\nhigh-priced food.\\nTo prepare poultry for cooking, the “dressing” of the chicken is often\\ndone now at the market. If it is necessary to do this at home, make an\\nincision with a sharp knife just inside of one of the legs, in the groin.\\nInsert the hand and remove all the entrails.

       " '231\\nCHAPTER XIV\\nFISH, SHELLFISH, AND OTHER MEAT SUBSTITUTES\\nFish and shellfish are valuable assets as food, so much so that the\\ngovernment has a Bureau of Fisheries, and has established stations at\\nintervals on the coast and on inland lakes for the study and production of\\nthose foods that come from salt and fresh water. We have used these\\nproducts of the waters as if the supply were limitless, forgetting that\\nfish and shellfish are living creatures with habits that we cannot ignore\\nwithout working havoc to the species. Young salmon and shad are hatched in\\nthe upper reaches of the rivers, and if we insist on trapping the mature\\nfish at the river mouth on their northern migrations, the number of young\\ndecreases, and salmon and shad become high-priced foods. To ignore fishery\\nand game laws is an ignorant and dishonest proceeding, with far-reaching\\neconomic results.\\nVarieties of fish.—In Bulletin No. 28 of the Office of Experiment\\nStations, United States Department of Agriculture, forty-four different\\nfish are listed, all used as food. A visit to the fish stall in the market\\nof a seaboard city will acquaint you with many interesting species. Fresh\\nand salt water fish differ in flavor, and there is a difference to be\\ndetected between fish from running, or from lake water, brook trout, for\\ninstance, having a superior flavor. The food supply also influences the\\nflavor, and both fresh and salt water fish have a better flavor when taken\\nfrom sandy and rocky bottoms rather than muddy. The habit of the fish also\\nhas233\\nan effect on the quality and taste. The chequit, for instance, is so\\nsluggish and easy to catch that it is sometimes called “lazy” or\\n“weakfish,” and it is watery and poor flavored compared with the shad, a\\nfish of more vigorous habits. The amount of fat also causes a difference\\nin flavor, such high flavored fish as salmon and shad containing much fat.\\nThe distinctive flavors of mackerel and herring are apparently not due to\\nfat, since their fat content is not particularly high. Among the most\\ncommon and best liked fish are bass, blackfish, bluefish, cod, flounder,\\nhaddock, halibut, herring, mackerel, porgy (sometimes called scup or\\nscuppaug), salmon, shad, smelt, weakfish, whitefish. Brook trout and\\nsalmon trout are luxuries.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 65.—Composition of fish.',\n",
       " 'Composition and nutritive value.—Figure 65 shows the composition of\\nseveral kinds. Compare their composition with that of meat. The nutritive\\ncontent is high, yet fish seems a lighter and less satisfying food than\\nmeat, although on the seaboard of some countries it is the chief animal\\nfood. The digestibility of fish and meat are about equal, but some\\nvarieties of fish are less digestible than others, this being true of the\\noily and strong-flavored fish,—herring, mackerel, salmon, and shad.\\nThere are popular prejudices for and against fish that are not warranted.\\nThe idea that fish is a “brain food” because it contains phosphorus was\\nexploded long since, for fish contains no more phosphorus than some other\\nfoods, and phosphorus is no more valuable to the brain than to the other\\ntissues.\\nFish, however, is valuable in the dietary for supplying protein and giving\\nvariety, and in season, it is one of the cheaper foods.\\nQuality of fish.—Fish deteriorates and decomposes much more rapidly than\\nmeat, and is at its best when cleaned\\nand234\\ncooked just after being caught.\\nIce will preserve fish for a short time only. If ever on a camping trip\\nyou have eaten bluefish caught in the surf, or trout from the brook,\\ncooked immediately, you know what flavor a fish may have. Fish should be\\nkilled immediately, and put on ice if they are not to be cooked at once.\\nIf there is no ice, clean the fish, sprinkle the flesh with pepper and\\nsalt, wrap in a wet cloth, and set in a breeze or draught.\\nWhen fish are transported over long distances they should be packed in ice\\nin refrigerator cars, and you will notice that the fishman in the shop\\nkeeps the fish on ice until he sells them.\\nIn selecting fish, see that the flesh feels firm and that the eyes are\\nstill bright. If you have a keen sense of smell, this will also guide you,\\nalthough to the novice the odor of fish may be disagreeable even if\\nuntainted.\\nFish in season and caught plentifully near by, are of good quality and\\nshould be cheap. Shad and salmon have their season in the spring, bluefish\\ncome north in the summer, sometimes as late as August, porgies are a\\nsummer and autumn fish, and smelt are abundant in the winter. Deep-sea\\nfish like cod and halibut have a long season, and may be bought at any\\ntime.\\nGENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " 'The scaling and cleaning of fish are important first steps.\\nIn the city this may be done for you at the market, but\\nsometimes on fishing expeditions when you are not a successful\\nfisher you may make yourself useful by cleaning the fish. Clean\\nthe fish on a large piece of paper. Use a sharp strong knife,\\nand rub off the scales from the tail to the head. To skin a fish\\nwell, you should first watch an expert. Cut through the skin of\\nthe back\\nand235\\nabdomen, loosen it at the tail and pull it off.\\nRemove the head, open the abdomen, and take out the entrails.\\nBurn the paper on which the fish has been cleaned. Fish is boned\\nby slitting the flesh down the back, and patiently separating\\nthe flesh from the side bones, and finally pulling out the spine\\nand attached bones. The strong odor of fish clings to everything\\nthe fish touches. Wash the fish, the knife, and your own hands\\nin cold water and salt. Always pour the water in which fish is\\nwashed or cooked down the sink at once, pour in some salt, and\\nflush the trap with cold water. The utensils, and dishes in\\nwhich fish is served, need very careful washing in several\\nwaters.\\nThe connective tissue of fish softens and dissolves more\\nreadily than does that of meat. Fish varies in the dryness of\\nthe flesh, but there is no such thing as tough fish, and the\\ntexture of the muscles is about the same in all parts of the\\nfish, although there is a difference in flavor in the dark and\\nwhite flesh when these both occur. On account of this\\ncharacteristic of the connective tissue the fish “falls apart”\\nand our aim must be to prevent this.\\nPrinciples of cooking.\\n1. The protein is affected as in all other foods where it\\noccurs.\\n2. The fat is melted.\\n3. Connective tissue quickly softened.\\nTo avoid the breaking of the fish it may be wrapped in cloth for\\nboiling, and the water should simmer only. The coating of small\\nfish or slices of large fish with beaten egg and crumbs tends to\\nhold it together. In all cases avoid overcooking. Fish is done\\nwhen a fork easily pierces it and separates the flakes of flesh\\nfrom the bone.\\n1. Boiled fish.\\nUse thick pieces of large fish for boiling, or\\nif small fish are used they may be boiled whole. Add salt and\\nvinegar to water in proportion of 1 tablespoonful of salt and\\ntwo of vinegar to three quarts of water. Use enough water\\nto cover the fish. Wrap the fish in cheesecloth to prevent\\nbreaking apart, and plunge into boiling water. Do not let\\nthe water boil after fish is in. The fish is done when the flesh\\nleaves the bone or when the flesh flakes apart easily. The usual\\ntime for a thick piece is 30-40 minutes.\\n236\\nMock Hollandaise sauce.',\n",

       " 'Laboratory management.—For individual work or work in groups\\nof two, small fish, as perch, may be procured and these may be\\nstuffed and baked in the period.\\nSHELLFISH\\nThe shellfish are of two classes; the mollusks including clams, mussels\\n(seldom used in this country), oysters, and scallops, and the\\ncrustaceans,—lobsters and crabs. None of the mollusks have high nutritive\\nvalue, but they are a protein food, and add to the variety of the diet.\\nThe composition of the oyster is shown in Fig. 65, and it will be noted\\nthat the fat percentage is small and the calorie value low.\\nThe oyster is raised in beds in the ocean, or bays often near the river\\nmouth, and it is the neighborhood to the river that makes it possible for\\nthe oyster to carry germs of contagion, particularly of typhoid fever,\\nwhen city sewage poured into the river passes over the oyster bed. Here,\\ntoo, government protection is essential, and this is a matter that has\\ncreated so much excitement that conditions are already improved. There is\\nan association of oyster growers who make a point of advertising clean\\noyster beds, and cleanly methods of handling and transporting.\\nOysters vary in size and flavor, the flavor seeming to depend upon the\\nlocality. The smaller are sought for serving raw, and the medium and\\nlarger for cooking. They are sold by the measure or number when taken from\\nthe shell, the latter giving the surer quantity; and the price is usually\\none cent apiece. They are in season from September to May. The whole flesh\\nof the oyster is soft and edible, even the muscle by which it opens and\\nshuts its shell being tender.\\nClams are of two kinds, distinguished differently in different places.\\nThey are known as hard and soft, or round\\nand239\\nlong, and in Rhode Island\\nthe hard round clam still bears the Indian name Quahaug, the soft shell\\nclam being the only “clam.”\\nThe long clam lies buried in the soft mud of creeks and muddy shores left\\nexposed at low tide, when they are dug by hoes from the mud. The round\\nclam lies on the bottom of shallow warm waters, and is raked with an\\nimplement made for the purpose. The round clam is used when very young and\\nsmall in place of raw oysters; but both kinds when matured have a tough\\nportion that is not softened in cooking, and that is more or less\\nindigestible. The long “neck” which protrudes from the shell has to be\\ndiscarded.\\nBoth kinds may be roasted in the shell, and are very palatable served hot\\nwith melted butter, salt, and pepper. They are most commonly used in soups\\nand in chowder. They are purchased by the quantity or number, are cheaper\\nthan oysters, and are always in season.\\nScallops, as purchased, are only a part of the animal in the shell,\\nconsisting solely of the round white muscle which operates the shell. The\\nescallop, or scallop, is migratory, moving by a shooting motion, the\\nmature scallops reaching the creeks and shores in the autumn, and though\\nfound in so-called beds they are not fixtures like the oysters. The flavor\\nis sweet, and they have a quality that makes them more or less\\nindigestible, especially when fried. They are very palatable and more\\ndigestible served in a stew made like an oyster stew. They are sold by the\\nmeasure and are cheap in season.\\nThe lobster is now a luxury, for methods of catching in the past have made\\nthem scarce in their old haunts. The lobster is a much more highly\\ndeveloped animal than the mollusk, having strong muscles inside its coat\\nof mail, and the flesh has a protein content that compares very favorably\\nwith240\\nmeat. When fresh, and not served with rich sauces or eaten at\\nirregular hours, it is not especially indigestible, and may be the main\\ndish at luncheon or supper, served simply with salt, pepper, and melted\\nbutter and not taken with meat foods. Its own delicious flavor needs no\\naddition in the way of sauces and high seasoning.\\nThe crab is essentially like the lobster, being smaller, and having a\\nsweeter flavor. The soft shell crab is caught just as the old shell is\\nshed, and is highly esteemed as a delicacy. Both lobsters and crabs are\\ncooked in the shell, and if allowed to die naturally before cooking they\\nare uneatable. They may be purchased alive or cooked, and one is surer of\\ntheir condition when they are bought alive. Twenty-five cents a pound is\\nnow an average price for lobsters in shell. Crabs are somewhat less\\nexpensive at times, but soft shells are always high-priced.\\nThe following table shows the food value of a few of this group in terms\\nof the weight of the 100-Calorie portion.\\n100-calorie Portions of Fish and Shellfish',\n",

It was interesting to see how many could be\\nmade for a cost of from six to ten cents for a family of five.\\nMaterials used for salad.—The word “salad” is said to be derived from the\\nLatin “salis” (salt) which implies that the salad has been looked upon\\nmore or less as a relish.

       " 'GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES',\n",
       " 'General directions.—The two important points in the preparation\\nof the material for salad are, first, that everything should\\nbe thoroughly dry, and, second, thoroughly chilled. The\\nimportance of these two points cannot be overemphasized, and\\nthey are of equal value in salad making. Many a salad is\\nunpalatable because it is watery and wilted. For the preparation\\nof green vegetables see Chapter VII. Vegetables should be cut in\\ncubes or sometimes in slices. Meat, poultry, and shellfish\\nshould be cut in small pieces or chopped. The prepared meat\\nshould be mixed with some\\nof250\\nthe oil and acid and allowed to\\nstand in an ice box for some time before it is dressed and\\narranged for serving. This process is called marinating in the\\ncookbooks, and gives a flavor to the salad that it cannot have\\nif a dressing is poured over the meat just before serving.\\nCombinations in salad.—Several well-known combinations will at\\nonce occur to you. Meat salads usually have a mixture of celery.\\nSeveral vegetables may be used together, as beans and carrots,\\nor carrots, peas, and string beans with lettuce. Apples, nuts,\\nand celery make a pleasing combination. Indeed there would seem\\nto be no end to the possibilities here.',\n",

       " 'Serving and garnishing.—The principle here is to make the dish\\nattractive with as little labor as possible. Everything served\\nas a garnish should be eatable. A bed of crisp dry lettuce\\nleaves is the most attractive setting for any salad. When this\\nis not procurable, cress makes an attractive border to a salad.\\nFigure 68 shows you a salmon jelly molded in a ring and\\nattractively served in lettuce.

From the point of\\nview of nutrition and digestibility this is more than is necessary, and\\nyou will notice that when both are served, the fruit is often declined.\\nLike the salad, the dessert may be made from a large variety of materials\\nand bears different names. There are hot puddings and cold puddings, pies\\nand tarts, jellies and ices and ice creams. It is very interesting to read\\nover the many dishes of this class in a cookbook and to attempt to\\nclassify them. If you are fortunate enough to have access to a cookbook of\\nthe eighteenth century, you will find that much labor was given to the\\npreparation of elaborate structures which served as table ornaments; even\\nnow you will find French cooks who spend much time in making elaborate\\ndisplays of their skill. For everyday life the dessert should be\\nattractive to the eye and yet simple.',\n",

It is prepared for use in desserts in a number of forms, the\\ngranular being the most convenient. Gelatin has the property,\\nfirst, of absorbing water, then of dissolving at the boiling temperature\\nof water and becoming stiff again when cool. After dissolving,\\nas it is cooling and just as it begins to thicken slightly, it can be\\nbeaten like white of egg. If beating is attempted while the liquid is\\nwarm, or again if it becomes too stiff, the result is not successful.\\nThis property makes it useful in the sponges and other fancy\\ndesserts where the light spongy texture is desirable.',\n",

       " '265\\nCHAPTER XVI\\nPREPARATION OF MEALS AND TABLE SERVICE\\nThe preparation of a number of dishes assembled for a meal requires a\\nskill quite different from that necessary for the making of a single dish.\\nA menu being decided upon, it needs an accurate sense of time,\\nforethought, and promptness, to have a number of dishes ready at the same\\ntime, or in proper sequence if several courses are served. Such questions\\nas the following must be answered:\\nTechnique of preparation.',\n",
       " '1. What steps in preparation can be taken ahead of time, as\\nwashing, paring, cutting, etc.?\\n2. What dishes take the longest to cook?\\n3. Which must be served the moment they are done?\\n4. Which can be kept hot for some time without injury?\\n5. Which can be finished and cooled perhaps several hours\\nbefore?\\n6. Do the dishes selected require the same utensils at the same\\ntime? (If so, the menus must be changed.)\\n7. What is the order of serving?\\nTo understand the bearing of these questions you will need to select some\\nmenu and make a plan for preparing it. (See exercises at the end of this\\nchapter.)\\nThe fact is obvious that in preparing a meal you cannot finish the dishes\\none at a time, but that steps individual to each dish must be interwoven\\nwith each other, and the cook must have them all “on her mind,” and is\\noften doing half a dozen things at once. As a high school girl, preparing\\na266\\npart of her first meal, remarked, “This is as good training as\\nmathematics.”\\nThe woman at home will devise many ways of easing and shortening the labor\\njust before the meal is served, avoiding haste and anxiety in this way.\\nWith the fireless cooker and other slow-cooking apparatus, the heavy work\\nmay sometimes be done far ahead of mealtime. A dessert can be prepared and\\nbe cooking as breakfast dishes are washed, and at the time left overs are\\nput away they can be arranged ready for serving, as in the case of poultry\\nor meat to be served cold. While the preparation of the midday meal is in\\nprogress, something can sometimes be done for the last meal, too. This,\\nindeed, is a field for generalship, and it is a successful campaign when\\nthe meals are all on time and well prepared, and the cook and family\\ncheerful.\\nImportant points in serving each dish.—Each dish should be perfectly\\ndone, neither over nor under cooked. All hot dishes should be hot, and\\ncold dishes cold. Lukewarm food is not agreeable. Bread and cake and some\\nkinds of pastry are the only foods that may have the temperature of the\\nroom. Sliced meat and salads should be cold. Chill chocolate éclairs\\nbefore serving and see how much they are improved; indeed, experiment with\\na number of foods that are usually served at room temperature.',\n",
       " 'To keep food hot.—A hot closet above a coal or gas range is\\nmade for this purpose, and steam heaters sometimes have\\nhot-closets. A double boiler is a help, and one utensil may be\\nset into a larger, filled with boiling water. Some dishes can be\\nset back on the stove, or over a simmering gas burner with an\\nasbestos mat underneath. The oven may be used sometimes, with\\nthe door set ajar. The food may be kept covered unless it will\\nsteam, in which case cover it with a towel. Serve food in hot\\ndishes.\\nTo keep food cool.—Leave the dish in the ice box until the last\\npossible moment. Sometimes serve with ice (butter in\\nwarm267\\nweather). If ice is lacking, use other cooling devices. Serve\\nin chilled dishes.\\nGarnishing the dish.—All food must be neatly placed in the\\ndish, and arranged or piled with some sort of symmetry, and this\\nis the most that some people have time to do. Many foods may be\\nserved in the utensil or dish in which they are cooked, and in\\nthe case of a baking dish, if its appearance is not neat, a\\nnapkin can be folded about it. The simplest form of garnish is\\nbrowning on the top, which makes many dishes attractive (mashed\\npotato).\\nMake the garnishing simple, and have it eatable when possible.\\nSlices of hard-boiled eggs on spinach, chopped parsley and\\nbutter on boiled or mashed potato, parsley and slices of lemon,\\nwith meat and fish.\\nVegetable borders are attractive and save labor in dish\\nwashing. Arrange the meat in the center of the platter, and pile\\nmashed potato, or boiled rice or peas or beans, or a mixture of\\nhot vegetables around the edge. This saves time in table\\nservice, too.\\nThe garnishing of salads, desserts, and cakes is treated in\\nprevious chapters.\\nTable equipment and service.—This is a place where beauty is a large\\nelement, and most people understand the charm of a daintily laid table, as\\nthe family gathers for a meal. But many factors must be taken into\\naccount, for it is an easy matter to pass from the simple and beautiful to\\nan extravagant display, to spend more on the dining-room equipment than\\nthe income warrants, and to waste much energy in unnecessary work. Our\\ngreat need here is to learn to see beauty in simplicity.

A piece of bread is folded in each\\nnapkin. If the first course is cold,—perhaps a grapefruit,—she arranges\\nthese at each place. If it is to be a hot bouillon, the cook tells her\\nthat all is ready, and then she informs the hostess that dinner or\\nluncheon is served.\\nThe details of this type of waiting vary with the place and the taste of\\nthe hostess, but the following method is simple and rapid.',\n",
       " 'Serving.—Serve everything from the side table. Hold the dish to\\nbe served firmly in two hands with a napkin underneath, a\\ntablespoon and fork being placed on the dish. Pass to the left\\nof the guest, and hold the dish at a convenient height and near\\nthe276\\nplate.

Some\\nhostesses have some of the courses arranged on individual plates\\nand placed, and these may be placed either from the left or\\nright. But the other method is simple and satisfactory.\\nThe finger bowls may be set on plates of dessert size with a\\ndoily underneath.

       " '278\\nCHAPTER XVII\\nTHE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD\\nThis is at all times an important matter, but the notable increase in food\\nprices, during the last decade, has made it a matter of interest to all.\\nThe cost of food is one item only in the whole cost of living, and this is\\naffected by many conditions in manufacture and commerce and the business\\nof the nations. Economists and others interested in social questions are\\nstudying the problem, but as yet they do not agree upon the cause, or\\ncauses, of the increased cost of living. We cannot hope, therefore, to\\nunderstand the situation fully; but we must be determined to spend money\\nas wisely as we can, and to learn what we may about food prices in\\nrelation to food values. There are a few causes of the difference in price\\nbetween one food and another that are more or less unchanging. The cost of\\nfood may be considered from several points of view. The question of the\\ncost for each individual a day and relation of cost and nutritive value\\nare studied in Chapter XVIII. The proportion of the income to be spent for\\nfood is taken up in Chapter XIX.\\nLabor and prices.—The amount of labor involved in producing a food\\nmaterial affects its price. Meats cost more than staple vegetable foods,\\nlike corn, wheat, or beans, because we must raise the corn first to feed\\nthe animals. Meat is as cheap as vegetable foods only when the animal can\\nfind its own food, as in the pioneer days of any country, when only a\\nsmall part of the land is under cultivation. To the Pilgrim Fathers, meat\\nwas cheaper than corn, in terms\\nof279\\nlabor, with deer at hand in the forest\\nand corn raised with difficulty in small clearings. Meat production is now\\nan industry, and the product an expensive one, especially as the wide\\ncattle ranges of our West, where the animals have formerly found natural\\nfood, are now used more and more for other purposes.\\nTransportation.—Carrying food from place to place increases its cost. In\\none sense this is another form of labor. Each person who handles the food\\nmaterial from producer to consumer adds something to what the consumer\\npays. We have heard much discussion of late of the “middleman,” and the\\neffort to bring the producer and consumer closer together. This simply\\nmeans doing away with some person who handles the product after it leaves\\nthe producer and before it reaches the consumer and who must have\\nsomething for his labor. In transportation there is another element\\ninvolved, the original cost of the means of conveyance; and the natural\\nwear and tear on the product are items that increase the final cost. The\\nmodern farmer who carries his produce to market in an auto truck must have\\na return for the original cost of the truck and the keeping of it in\\nrepair. The long-distance railway furnishes cold-storage cars, and the\\ncost of these and their maintenance affect freight rates. A peach from\\nSouth Africa costs from fifty to sixty cents in the Boston market. It is\\nprobably true, in this case, that a fancy price is asked because African\\nfruit is a novelty here; but the difficulty and expense of long-distance\\ntransportation naturally make it costly.\\nDemand and supply.—The relation of demand to supply affects the price of\\nfood in a way not difficult to understand. Where the supply is permanently\\nsmall and the demand widespread, the price of the particular food material\\nwill be high, and vice versa. Olive oil is a good example of the\\npermanently280\\nhigh-priced food. California olive oil brings a high price\\nnot only because it is pure and well flavored, but because many people\\nwant it, and the industry is a small one. Many years are needed to\\nestablish an olive grove, and olive raising is not a popular way of making\\nmoney, because it is slow. One enterprising American firm has bought an\\nolive grove in Spain, and is using new methods there, but the product,\\nthough delicious, is no cheaper. Although the manufacture of olive oil\\nwill doubtless remain a rather small industry, the use of olive oil is\\nincreasing, in this country, at least. It does not seem likely, therefore,\\nto become a cheap form of fat.\\nWe find nearly the opposite of this in cottonseed oil, a large supply and\\na relatively smaller demand making a low price. The seed (a by-product of\\nthe cotton industry) contains a large quantity of oil, and it is not all\\nused as food. Therefore, it is permanently a low-priced fat, as contrasted\\nwith the permanently high-priced fat, olive oil.\\nAgricultural conditions.—There are two things of which the farmer can\\nnever feel sure, the kind of weather to expect and the general character\\nof the season. Of course, the season affects the quality and the amount of\\nany crop, and this, again, influences the price.\\nAnother aspect of the effect of season on food is this: that a food is in\\nits own locality cheaper when it is in season than at other times of year,\\nwhen it has to be brought from a distance.\\nInsect pests and plant diseases not infrequently spoil a crop, and the\\nmarket price goes up with the smaller supply. This is what happened not\\nlong since to the potato crop and potato prices, when potatoes were\\naffected by the potato blight. Moreover, if the farmer succeeds in keeping\\nhis crop free from a particular pest, it means a more or less permanent\\nincrease in his expenses, for in fighting insects\\nand281\\nfungi there is an\\noutlay for machinery and chemicals, and much labor is expended.\\nUnfortunately, injurious insects and plant diseases are on the increase,\\nand this may mean a permanent rise in the cost of certain foods. Another\\nfact has to be reckoned with in comparing the prices of different foods.\\nSome vegetables are more difficult to raise than others, even when the\\nseason is favorable, and the insects at least partly conquered. Some\\nplants have more vitality than others, and grow under almost any condition\\nof soil and moisture.\\nAnimal diseases must also affect the price of food. If a large number of\\ncattle are found to have tuberculosis, and are condemned as food, healthy\\ncattle bring a higher price, because, again, the supply is small in\\nrelation to the demand.\\nQuality of food.—Poor food always costs less money than good food, but it\\nmay not be economy to buy it. There may be more usable material in one\\ngood apple at five cents than in three wormy ones for five.\\nForm and place in which food is sold.—Food in the package costs more than\\nin bulk, and each fancy label adds a fraction to the cost. Plate-glass\\nwindows and ribbon decorations in a shop and the large expense of rent on\\na fashionable street are all paid for by the consumer.\\nRelative cost of home and shop products.—When prepared food of any kind\\nis purchased, one pays for raw material plus the cost of fuel and the\\nlabor involved in the cooking and the cleaning of apparatus and kitchen.\\nFor example, canned soup sold by one of the best manufacturers brings a\\ngood price because so much time and labor are used in a careful inspection\\nof all material, and in keeping up a high standard of cleanliness.\\nRemember, too, that whenever cooked food appears on the table, these two\\nitems, fuel and labor, are in reality added to the cost of the raw\\nmaterial.282\\nWe may not pay cash always for the labor, but it must be\\naccounted for in time and energy. The woman who says, “My time doesn’t\\ncount,” has a poor opinion of herself. Whether or not it is better to buy\\ncooked food or to prepare food at home is discussed on page 292.\\nOther elements in food prices.—So far we have considered those causes of\\nfood prices that are what may be called “natural,” always to be taken into\\naccount, and only partly under our control. There are others that have to\\ndo with big business methods and interests and that have great influence\\nat some one period in a nation’s life, and less at others. They are more\\nor less under our control if we have the wisdom and courage to act. A\\ndiscussion of these causes is part of the study of economics proper, and\\nwe can only stop by the way to think of them for a moment.\\nTransportation must always increase cost, as we have learned, but bad\\nmethods, involving the handling of food by many people, increase it\\nunnecessarily. Our present methods of marketing food are clumsy, and not\\neconomical, especially in large cities. The subject is being seriously\\nstudied with a view to improvement, possibly by the establishment of\\npublic markets.\\nAt present we have a bewildering state of things, but the housekeeper who\\nsincerely desires, can learn to buy and prepare the less costly foods in\\nan appetizing way, and leave nothing for the garbage pail but the parts\\nthat are actually not eatable.\\nComparative costs.—It would be useless to print here a list of actual\\nprices, since they vary in different localities, and are constantly\\nchanging. This list can be made by yourselves in your notebooks for your\\nown home town, and for the current year. The table on page 318 is a guide,\\nhowever, for in spite of fluctuations in prices there are\\ncertain283\\nfoods\\nthat are permanently more economical than others; for example, grain\\nproducts than meats, for reasons already explained. As a rule, the rising\\ncost of food has been so general as not to change greatly the relative\\neconomy of the different types of food as compared with each other.\\nCost and nutritive value.—The discussion of cost has dealt so far with\\nthe cost of food materials as they are found in the market. What we are\\nreally seeking to learn is the amount of nutritive material to be\\nobtained for a given sum of money, and in order to do this, we must think\\nof our purchases in terms of the foodstuffs and their values. The\\naccompanying table from a government\\nbulletin[17]\\ngives an estimate of\\ncost from this point of view in terms of protein and fuel value. Notice\\nthat wheat bread is a cheap food, standing first in the amount of building\\nmaterial and energy.\\nAmounts of Protein and Energy Obtained for 10 Cents Expended\\nFor Bread and Other Foods at Certain Assumed Prices per Pound',\n",

(See Chapter XVIII.) Another method of\\nestimating economy for this purpose is by calculating the cost of\\n100-Calorie portions of various food materials. A table giving such a\\ncomparison will be found in the next chapter.\\nPurchasing Food\\nIn addition to the general principles of buying discussed in Chapter XXI\\nthere are some details to be studied in purchasing food.\\nPersonal attention in buying food.—It is absolutely necessary to visit\\nthe market and the grocery where food is purchased. The purchaser would\\nnot fail to visit a shop before deciding to patronize it regularly, but\\nfrequent calls are necessary if buying is to be economical. Select the\\ngrocery, market, and bakery with a view to their cleanliness. Notice if\\nthe doors and windows are screened, and if proper effort is made to catch\\nflies that may have entered. Refuse to buy food that is exposed upon the\\nsidewalk, and if it is within doors, see that it is protected from dust\\nand flies. The best markets now have tiled walls and floors, which help to\\ninsure cleanliness. The difference in odor is marked between a market that\\nis properly cleaned daily, and one where the proprietor uses uncleanly\\nmethods. Meat and vegetables, in particular, should be personally selected\\nwhenever this is possible. The butcher must understand that the purchaser\\nis familiar with the different cuts of meat and that honest service is\\ndemanded in regard to the quality, trimming, and weight of the meat. One\\ndoes not want to be too suspicious, but it is well for the butcher to know\\nthat the purchaser has a set of standard scales at home by which to\\nprove285\\nthe accuracy of his weighing. It is also important to inspect fruit and\\nvegetables for quality and cost.\\nQuantities in which to purchase food.—The amount that one purchases of a\\ncertain food depends on its keeping qualities, and upon the storage space\\navailable at home. A general rule may be stated: Buy perishable foods in\\nsmall quantities; non-perishable foods in large. The reason for buying in\\nlarger quantity is that the cost is somewhat less, although sometimes it\\nseems but little less. Some one has remarked that no one is a good buyer\\nwho does not consider a quarter of a cent. In a modern house or apartment\\nwhere there is not room for a barrel of flour or sugar, then the quantity\\nmust be gauged by the space. The same is true of canned goods as of flour\\nand sugar. Buying by the dozen saves a little on each can if you have\\nshelf room for piling the cans.\\nFoods may be classed in this connection as perishable, semi-perishable,\\nand non-perishable. This depends somewhat for any one housekeeper upon the\\nsize of her refrigerator, and upon an available place where food may be\\ncool, even if not so cold as in the refrigerator. Those foods classed here\\nas perishable are those which readily “spoil,” that is, those that are\\naffected by mold and bacteria on account of the moisture that they\\ncontain, and also those that lose flavor and freshness quickly. Those most\\neasily affected should be kept the coldest; those in the semi-perishable\\ngroup do not deteriorate so rapidly, although a low temperature is\\ndesirable with all of these. Under the non-perishable foods are classed\\nthose that are not subject to bacteria or mold in ordinary circumstances.\\nThese should be kept dry, however, and never in a heated place. In a\\nsense, no food material is non-perishable. Insects sometimes develop in\\nthe cereal products, for instance, and the material is\\nthus286\\nrendered\\nunfit for food. The food adjuncts do not spoil except as they lose flavor\\nif kept too long.',\n",
       " 'Perishable.—Milk, cream, uncooked meat, uncooked fish,\\nshellfish, berries, fruits with delicate skins, lettuce, and\\nvegetables that wilt easily.\\nSemi-perishable.—Butter, eggs, cooked meat and fish, root\\nvegetables, cooked vegetables, left overs in general, skin\\nfruits like apples, bananas, oranges, and lemons, dried fruits,\\nscalded milk and cream, smoked and salted fish and meats, open\\nmolasses and sirup.\\nNon-perishable.—Flour, meals and cereals, sugar, salt, and\\nother condiments and flavorings, jellies, preserves and canned\\ngoods, coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate.\\nSuggestions for buying.—Milk and cream must be delivered daily. The\\naverage amount used by the family is the regular order. Fresh meat should\\nbe delivered on the day wanted unless the refrigerator is large with a\\nspace for hanging meat. Even then, it should not be kept more than\\ntwenty-four hours. Meat should not be placed directly on the ice. Fresh\\nberries and delicate vegetables should be delivered on the day wanted.\\nButter and eggs may be purchased once a week; other semi-perishables in\\nquantities depending on storage space. It is economical to buy a box of\\nlemons, and the root vegetables in large quantities. Flour and sugar are\\npurchased by the bag or barrel; lump sugar, in boxes. Breakfast cereals\\nare best bought in packages, and it is wise not to buy a large number at\\none time. It is better to purchase oftener and have fresher material.\\nCoffee may be bought in pound cans, but it is economy to purchase it in\\nfive or ten pound quantities, unground. Tea comes in closely sealed\\npackages, in 1⁄4, 1⁄2, and 1 lb. and larger. Cocoa is bought in 1⁄2 lb.\\ncans, but it is economy to buy in large cans if it is frequently used.\\nMacaroni is bought by the package, and the number at one time\\nmust287\\ndepend\\non how much it is used in the menu. Rice, tapioca, and sago may be bought\\nin bulk and kept in tin or glass jars. Salt by the bag or box. Spices,\\nground, in tight boxes; whole in bulk, to be kept in tightly closed cans.\\nMolasses comes by the gallon or in cans. If in bulk, it is usually acid;\\nin the can it is not. Vinegar comes by the gallon, or in bottles. Canned\\nand preserved goods, singly, by the dozen, or case. Bakery products, when\\nbought at all, should be purchased daily, or every other day. Do not buy\\nso much that stale bread accumulates.\\nWeights, measures, and packages.—The buyer is at a disadvantage here in\\nregard to quantities, for the baskets in which fruits and vegetables are\\nsold do not always conform to the standard dry measures, and dishonest\\ndealers evade the law in regard to the use of standard scales. Even if\\nthey have the standard, they resort to tricks that give the customer short\\nweights. Here the Bureau of Weights and Measures, with its Commissioner\\nand corps of inspectors, comes to the aid of the purchaser. Effective work\\nhas been done in our cities in enforcing the laws, and this work\\ncontinues.\\nSelling fruit, vegetables, and even eggs by weight would simplify matters\\nin many ways, and this is the custom in some parts of the United States\\nwith vegetables and fruit, although it is not yet a common practice; with\\neggs it seems more convenient to sell by the dozen, but grading according\\nto size is a step toward standardization.\\nThe alluring packages in which so many articles are offered are quite\\nuneven as to the quantities they contain. They certainly do away with some\\nhandling of food, and they keep out dust. Unfortunately, an attractive\\npackage does not guarantee a clean factory or clean handling in the\\npacking. Dried figs, for example, in pretty baskets are\\nsometimes288\\npacked\\nin uncleanly places. Moreover, small packages are poor economy, since the\\nbox adds to the cost of the food material, and sometimes there seems even\\nmore package than food. If the family consumes many biscuits or\\n“crackers,” it costs considerably more to buy them in packages. Yet, these\\nare convenient, and should be cleanly, and are justified for these\\nreasons, provided the housekeeper does not buy many small packages.\\nThe quantities in canned goods are variable and sometimes below measure\\nwhen purchased from a second-rate dealer. In September, 1914, the net\\nweight amendment to the National Food Law will go into effect, after\\nwhich, in general, foods sold in packages must be labeled to show net\\nweight or measure or numerical count.\\nAs already suggested, you should own standard scales for testing the\\npurchases made by weight, even baker’s bread. Buy fruit and vegetables by\\nthe quart, peck, and bushel, rather than by the basket of uncertain\\nmeasure. Examine baskets containing small fruits to see if they have false\\nbottoms. If you discover small measure, report at once to the dealer, and\\nto whatever authority has charge of such matters in your town.\\nQuality.—Modern methods of manufacture, transportation, and storage make\\nit difficult to determine the history and quality of food we purchase in\\nthe markets. Yet the consumer has a natural right to know if the food\\noffered for sale is the best of its kind; fresh eggs, clean milk, meat\\nfrom healthy animals, untainted and free from harmful preservatives, sound\\nvegetables and fruit, manufactured and preserved foodstuffs unspoiled by\\nthe manufacturing processes, free from harmful preservatives, and of good\\nflavor. Many people must be in danger of forgetting the flavor of a\\nfresh-laid egg. The familiar signs in many small shops,\\n“Fresh289\\neggs,”\\n“Strictly fresh eggs,” “Fancy eggs,” are amusing, but they bespeak an\\nunnatural state of things.\\nAs our business methods have created conditions beyond the control of the\\nindividual consumer it follows that we must take concerted action, and\\nmake and enforce whatever laws are necessary. This is done partly through\\nthe Federal government, and partly through state laws and municipal\\nordinances. Thus, while we may not know the actual conditions in which\\nfood is produced, we may through legislation seek to insure that the food\\nwe buy shall be\\n(1) what it purports to be in kind and amount,\\n(2) free from deterioration or unwholesome conditions,\\n(3) possessed of full nutritive value.\\nThe Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, commonly known as “The\\nPure Food Law,” and on which subsequent legislation by most of the states\\nhas been largely based, defines the main types of adulteration and\\nmisbranding, but, except in the case of confectionery and of habit-forming\\ndrugs, does not name the specific substances which are to be prohibited or\\nrestricted in use, nor does the law itself contain standards of\\ncomposition for foods.\\nAccording to this law a food is deemed adulterated:\\n(1) If any substance has been mixed or packed with it so as to reduce or\\nlower or injuriously affect its quality or strength.\\n(2) If any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part.\\n(3) If any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part abstracted.\\n(4) If it be mixed, colored, coated, powdered, or stained in a manner\\nwhereby damage or inferiority is concealed.\\n(5) If it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious\\ningredient which may render such article injurious to health.',\n",
       " '290\\n(6) If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed, or putrid\\nanimal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit for food,\\nor if it be the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died\\notherwise than by slaughter.\\nAnd a food is deemed to be misbranded:\\n(1) If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the distinctive\\nname of another article.\\n(2) If it be labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead the purchaser,\\nor purport to be a foreign product when not so, or if the contents shall\\nhave been substituted in whole or in part, or if it fail to bear a\\nstatement on the label of the quantity or proportion of any narcotic or\\nhabit-forming drug which it contains.\\n(3) If it bear an incorrect statement of weight or measure.\\n(4) If the package containing it or its label shall bear any statement,\\ndesign, or device which is false or misleading in any particular.\\nFor a fuller discussion of the basis of pure food legislation and the\\nessential features of the United States laws see Sherman’s “Food\\nProducts,” from which a part of the summary here given is drawn.\\nThe modern cold storage plant is of immense service in keeping food from\\nthe season of abundance to that of scarcity, but it may prove worse than\\nuseless if improperly managed. State and federal laws must control the\\nmanagement, and government inspection must be thorough. Cold storage would\\nbe a benefit to all under proper conditions of management, and the prices\\nof many foods would be evenly adjusted by the maintenance of a steady\\nsupply. Many states now have laws regulating cold storage plants and there\\nis every reason to hope that the abuses which\\nhave291\\nsometimes existed will\\nbe eliminated and the usefulness of cold storage extended.\\nWe may feel that the progress of the pure food movement has been most\\nsatisfactory, even though much more remains to be done. The states\\ngenerally have either enacted new food laws, or revised their laws\\nfollowing the national law. Under the national law over 2000 prosecutions\\nhave already (1913) been decided in favor of the government.\\nCongress has passed an even more stringent law for meat inspection\\nsupplementary to the Pure Food Law with ample appropriation for its\\nenforcement. Moreover, in 1913, the Secretary of Agriculture appointed\\noutside experts to inspect meat-packing establishments throughout the\\ncountry. This inspection is to check up the regular work being done by the\\nBureau of Animal Industry.\\nThe enforcing of federal and state laws has already largely stopped the\\nmisbranding of package foods as to weight or measure, cheap substitutions,\\nthe removal of valuable ingredients, and the sale of decomposed or tainted\\nfood derived from diseased animals. Remember that abuses can be kept down\\nto any extent that we are willing to pay for. Taxpayers must appropriate\\nmoney to pay for inspection, for laws, no matter how good, will not insure\\npure food unless carried out faithfully by an adequate number of specially\\ntrained inspectors.\\nIn the face of all these difficulties we must not be frightened into that\\nstate of mind where danger seems to lurk in every mouthful. We must use\\ncaution and common sense in our buying, and earnestly support every good\\nmovement for bettering conditions.\\nThere is a certain difference in quality even at a first class dealer’s\\nthat one must learn to distinguish. One can of peaches will cost more than\\nanother, because the peaches\\nare292\\nlarger. If it is only this, and there is\\nonly a slight difference in flavor in favor of the more costly, buy the\\ncheaper by all means. A fancy brand of imported preserves brings a fancy\\nprice which it is not worth while to pay. We have to learn to distinguish\\nbetween poor and good quality, on the one hand, and between good and what\\nmay be called “fancy,” on the other. We should demand the good, but most\\nof us cannot afford the “fancy.”\\nReady-cooked foods.—More and more cooked food, canned or otherwise, is\\ntaking its place in the market. When canned goods were first manufactured\\non a large scale they comprised fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish, but\\nwe are now accustomed to a miscellaneous variety, including soups, baked\\nbeans, puddings, and pudding sauces, spaghetti, hashed meat, and\\nshellfish. Bakery products have a larger sale than ever, and are found in\\nsmall towns, and even in country districts carried there by bakers’\\nwagons. In our large cities we find the “delicatessen shop” very common,\\nwhere small portions of cooked meats and fowl may be purchased after the\\ncustom of Europe, and these stores are open even on Sunday.\\nHow shall we decide what is best for us in our buying? We must not condemn\\nentirely the buying of cooked food without a careful study of the\\nsituation. The custom has grown with changes in our mode of living,\\nespecially in cities, where the small apartment is common, and where gas\\nis the fuel. Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare foods that\\nneed long and slow cooking, and these processes are more expensive when\\ngas is used. The long slow cooking of soup and beans, the even baking of\\nbread, are difficult to accomplish. The odors from these processes fill\\nthe small apartment, and scent it for some time, and this is unpleasant at\\nall seasons.',\n",
       " '293\\nTake another example, the canning and preserving of fruits. The first cost\\nof the fruit is usually high in the city, and this plus the sugar and the\\ngas, and the labor and the lack of storage space make it seem\\nimpracticable in these conditions, and many people decide in favor of\\nbuying goods already canned. Such housekeeping is simplified by buying\\ncooked products to some extent. The fireless cooker helps here, but not\\nfor all processes. Counting in fuel, the cost is not so much greater as we\\nmight suppose; and comfort and convenience are increased. Under other\\nconditions, even in the city, a different conclusion is reached. If coal\\nis the fuel, and a steady fire is kept, perhaps in winter for heating\\npurposes, then it is economy to cook most food materials at home.\\nIn the country and small village different conditions prevail. Here the\\nabundance of certain fruits in season makes it economical to can and dry,\\neven counting fuel and labor. In some sections many people can their own\\nvegetables also. However, even in the country in the summer, it is a\\ndecided relief to the farmer’s wife, probably short of “help,” to win a\\nlittle leisure by buying staple bakery products. Here if strict economy is\\nnot necessary, is it not better to save strength rather than money? Each\\nhousekeeper must work out these problems for herself.\\nEXERCISES\\n1.

It is possible to\\nmake people sick with good food, if it is badly selected and fed at wrong\\ntimes or in unsuitable amounts. Whether children grow to their full size\\nand strength depends more upon the choice of their food than upon any\\nother one thing. The effect of food is strikingly shown in the case of the\\nwhite rats in Fig. 74. The two upper ones are the same age. Both had the\\nsame mother, lived in the same kind of clean cages, and had plenty of\\nfood, but the diet of the upper was good for growth, while that for the\\nmiddle one was not. It remained perfectly well, but became stunted because\\nof the character of its food. You can see that it resembles the lowest one\\nin the illustration, which is only one fourth as old. In this chapter we\\nshall consider how and when and in what amounts to serve food so that\\nevery one may get from it the fullest benefit in both health and\\nhappiness.',\n",

A group\\nconsisting of a professional man, his wife, and three children under 16\\nwill require about 10,000 Calories per day; a workingman’s family with the\\nsame number of children from 12,000 to 14,000, because of the harder work\\nwhich both parents and possibly the children will do.\\nProtein requirement.—Since few of our foods consist of a single\\nfoodstuff, and we are not likely to make even a single meal on pure fat,\\nor pure protein, or pure carbohydrate alone, we are sure to get some\\nbuilding material in any diet, but we must see to it that we are getting\\namounts which furnish the best possible conditions for growth and repair.\\nAs we have already seen, nitrogen in the form of protein is necessary to\\nthe life of every cell in the body.

       " 'It is interesting to work out other combinations which give these good\\nproportions.\\nAsh requirement.—We are also assured of ash in any ordinary diet, but\\nsome attention should be paid to kind and amount, especially as many\\ncommon foods have lost the parts richest in ash. Patent flour, for\\ninstance, made from the inner part of the grain, is not so rich in ash as\\nwhole or cracked wheat. Valuable salts are also lost in cooking vegetables\\nwhen the water in which they were cooked is thrown away. If not desired\\nwith the vegetable, this should be saved for gravy or soup. It is not\\nnecessary to calculate a definite amount of ash for the diet, if\\nash-bearing foods are freely used. By reference to the table on page 384\\nyou can see what foods are valuable for supplying the important kinds of\\nash. Milk is particularly rich in calcium and hence is required when the\\nbones are growing. Eggs have iron and phosphorus in forms well suited to\\ngrowth. But if eggs are too\\nexpensive,304\\nthe vegetables and fruits\\ngenerally will supply these same substances.\\nDiet for growth.—Diets made in the chemical laboratory from mixtures of\\npure (isolated) protein, fat, carbohydrate, and ash to satisfy all the\\nrequirements which we have so far mentioned, do not behave alike when fed\\nto animals. The kind of protein is important as well as the amount. This\\nis shown by experiments in which only one protein is fed at a time. On\\nsome, the animals will not thrive. On others, adult animals do very well,\\nbut the young ones become stunted like the one shown on page 295. Milk has\\nbeen found to contain proteins on which young animals can thrive. But even\\nin diets containing the protein from milk, young animals do not develop\\nnormally unless the salts of milk are added too. No perfect substitute for\\nmilk has ever been found. During the first year of life, a child lives on\\nit almost exclusively; for the first five years it should be considered\\nthe most important article in the diet; and throughout the period of\\ngrowth it should be freely used if children are to become vigorous men and\\nwomen. If not liked as a beverage, it can be used in cocoa, or cereal\\ncoffee, in soups, puddings, and other dishes. Considering what milk may\\nsave in the way of more expensive protein foods, such as eggs and meat,\\nand of ash-supplying foods like fruits and vegetables, it is to be\\nregarded as a cheap food. It is possible to get the proper amounts of fuel\\nand protein from white bread and meat, but such a diet is poorly balanced\\nas to ash constituents and especially lacks calcium. It would need to be\\nbalanced by adding some fruit or vegetable and even then would not contain\\nas much calcium as is best for growing people. A diet of bread and milk,\\non the other hand, is so nearly perfectly balanced (supplying fuel,\\nprotein, and ash constituents in suitable amounts) that it can be taken\\nexclusively305\\nfor a long time. Whole wheat bread and milk would be even\\nbetter, because the whole wheat would supply more iron, in which white\\nbread and milk are not rich. The addition of fruits and vegetables to the\\nbread and milk diet would also be an advantage—partly for the same\\nreason.\\nOther foods especially valuable for growth are eggs and cereals from whole\\ngrains. Children should acquire the habit of eating fruits and green\\nvegetables of all kinds, for when they are older and likely to take less\\nmilk and cereals, the fruits and vegetables supply important ash\\nconstituents and also help to prevent constipation.\\nThe foods good for children are also good for adults, but the latter can\\nkeep their bodies in good repair with less protein and ash in proportion\\nto body weight than are required during growth, and many kinds of protein\\nserve for repair. If there are not enough milk and eggs to go around,\\nadults can take meat, nuts, peas, beans and bread for protein, and trust\\nto these and fruit and vegetables for ash. When the body has been wasted\\nby sickness, however, a return to the foods of growth, especially a diet\\nof milk and eggs, is best for building it up again.\\nThe number of meals in a day.—Knowing how much and what kinds of food are\\nbest for each member of the family, we must next find out how to divide\\nthe total food for the day into meals. Few of us could take our required\\nfuel in one meal, and if we could, we should probably be hungry before the\\ntime for the next meal. Some persons get along very well with two meals a\\nday, but usually their fuel requirement is not high. Most people are more\\ncomfortable and more likely to eat a suitable amount in a deliberate\\nfashion if they have three meals a day. When large amounts of fuel have to\\nbe taken, four or five meals may be better than three; babies who have to\\neat in proportion to their\\nsize,306\\noften 21⁄2 times as much as their\\nmothers, take 21⁄2 times as many meals, i.e. 7 or 8 in a day.\\nThe amount of food for each meal.—While the number of meals depends\\nlargely on the amount to be eaten in the whole day, and the appetite of\\nthe subject, the amount at each meal is most influenced by the nature of\\nthe daily occupation. The baby with nothing to do but eat and sleep has\\nmeals uniform in kind and amount. The business man who works very hard\\nthrough the middle of the day, and has not time to take an elaborate meal,\\nnor time to rest after it so that it may digest easily, takes a light\\nluncheon and makes up for it at breakfast and dinner. The outdoor worker\\nwho has a long hard day and expends much energy, takes an hour at noon for\\na substantial dinner, in addition to a hearty breakfast and supper and\\nsometimes a mid-forenoon or mid-afternoon lunch.\\nRegularity of meals.—More important than the number of meals is\\nregularity as to time of eating and amount of food. Training for the\\ndigestive tract is just as important as training the eye or the hand or\\nthe brain. We cannot expect good digestions if we have a hearty luncheon\\nto-day, none at all to-morrow, and perhaps a scanty and hasty late one the\\nnext day. To take food into the stomach between meals is to demoralize the\\ndigestive system. Foods that are excellent as part of a meal provoke\\nheadaches and bad complexions, and many symptoms of a protesting stomach,\\nwhen taken between meals. The younger the person, the more important is\\nregularity. Little children soon suffer if their meals are not “on the\\nminute.” Adults have more difficulty in controlling their time, but if\\nthey have to be late to meals, they should be more careful than usual to\\neat slowly and to choose plain simple food that will digest easily.\\nMental attitude toward meals.—Good food may be provided at the proper\\ntime and yet the members of a\\nfamily307\\nmay fail to keep well and happy\\nunless they come to meals in the right condition. Haste, chill,\\nexhaustion, anxiety, excitement, fretfulness, or anger may interfere with\\nthe digestion of the most digestible of meals. Orderly table service, good\\nmanners, and cheerful conversation are very important factors in the\\nsuccess of a meal. Peace and joy as well as “calories” are watchwords of\\ngood nutrition.\\nBalanced meals.—Having determined how many meals to serve in the day and\\nwhat their hours shall be, the next question is how to choose and\\ndistribute the constituents of the day’s ration so as to promote\\ndigestibility and satisfaction. A meal of pure protein, or fat, or\\ncarbohydrate would not be relished, and would have some physiological\\ndisadvantages. Digestion is likely to be more complete on a mixed diet. A\\nmeal of carbohydrate alone leaves the stomach more quickly than any other\\nkind, and one would feel hungry before the next meal, though one might\\nhave had plenty of fuel; a meal of fat alone would leave the stomach very\\nslowly, and one would not have so good an appetite for the next meal; a\\nmeal of pure protein would stimulate heat production without any\\nparticular advantages, except possibly in very cold weather: it would be\\ndecidedly undesirable in hot weather. For these and other reasons it is\\nbest to have the different foodstuffs represented in each meal, and to see\\nthat no one contains an excess of fat, which tends to retard all\\ndigestion. This is what is usually meant by a balanced meal, but it may\\nalso include care that about the same proportion of fuel is served at the\\nsame meal each day. A meal does not need to be “balanced” in quite the\\nsame sense as a day’s ration. The latter must have a definite amount of\\nfuel, a suitable proportion of protein, ash well represented, some food\\nfor bulk, the whole selected with regard for the physical condition,\\ntastes, habits, and pocketbooks of those to be fed.',\n",
       " '308\\nMenus.—Food taken at a stated time constitutes a meal. It may consist of\\na single food material, as bread, or a single dish, as soup; or it may\\ncontain many kinds of food and many dishes. When the day’s ration consists\\nof a single food, there is no trouble in arranging the bill of fare, for\\nall meals are alike. But as soon as we have two foods, we may consider\\nwhether they will digest better if eaten together or separately, and which\\nway they will please the palate better. Balanced diets do not necessarily\\nafford attractive menus. Macaroni and oatmeal would make a fairly well\\nbalanced meal except as regards ash constituents, but no one would call\\nsuch a combination pleasing. By the substitution of a little cheese and an\\norange for the oatmeal, a meal containing about the same fuel value and\\nproportion of protein could be arranged, and it would certainly appeal\\nmore to the appetite, and furnish better proportions of ash constituents.\\nIn the construction of the menu for the day or meal, we must consider not\\nonly food values and time of day and combinations which shall be\\ndigestible, but flavor, color, texture, and temperature of our foods. The\\nstudy of digestible combinations belongs to the science of nutrition. The\\nharmonious blending of tastes, odors, colors, and the like is an art. Just\\nas there are pleasing combinations of sound, so there are harmonies of\\nflavor; certain dishes seem naturally to “go together.” Habit has a great\\ndeal to do with food combinations. A Chinaman would not eat sugar on rice;\\na Japanese would not cook beans with molasses as the Bostonian does. It is\\ninteresting to experiment with new combinations, and study to find out why\\nold ones are pleasing. Why do we like crackers with soup? Butter on bread?\\nToast with eggs? Peas with lamb chops?\\nDigestible menus.—Some of our eating habits are worth preserving and\\ncultivating. Fresh fruit for breakfast\\nstimulates309\\nthe appetite and helps\\nto prevent or overcome constipation. A mild-flavored food like cereal is\\nbetter relished before we have had meats or other highly flavored food.\\nSoup at the beginning of a meal puts the stomach in better condition to\\ndigest the food that follows. Ice cream at the end of a meal is less\\nlikely to chill the stomach than at the beginning. Bread and butter afford\\na good combination of fat and carbohydrate. Crackers help in the breaking\\nup of cheese into particles easy to digest.\\nNot all of our eating habits are good, however. Griddlecakes, melted\\nbutter, and maple sirup taste good, but the cakes make a pasty mass\\ndifficult for digestive juices to penetrate. The sirup is likely to\\nferment, and the butter coating the whole delays digestion greatly.\\nChicken salad is popular, but combinations of protein with much fat (as in\\nthe mayonnaise dressing) always digest very slowly. Simple dishes, without\\nrich sauces or gravies, and not excessively high in fat, are easiest of\\ndigestion. Pastries, fried foods, meats with much fat, like pork and\\nsausage, are always more or less difficult and should be attempted only by\\nthe strong, or when the body is free from physical or nervous weariness,\\nand not about to undertake mental work.\\nAttention to the art of menu making not only helps to make the diet easier\\nto digest, but also better balanced. Foods which are similar in color,\\nflavor, and texture, like potatoes and rice, are not artistic in\\ncombination, and it is better to substitute for one of them a green\\nvegetable, or meat or butter, in which case we get a better balance, as\\nmore ash, protein, or fat would then be included with the starch of the\\nrice or potato.\\nIn making the bill of fare it is a great mistake to consider each meal by\\nitself alone. If we do so, some days are likely to be very high in fuel,\\nwhile others may be very low.\\nThen,310\\ntoo, the impression left from one\\nmeal carries over to the next. We do not care to see on the dinner table\\nthe same foods that we saw at luncheon. Our love of variety is one of\\nnature’s ways of seeing to it that we get different kinds of foodstuffs in\\nour diet. Variety stimulates appetite, but this does not mean a great\\nvariety at one meal. The truest variety is obtained by a few well-selected\\ndishes at each meal. If we do not exhaust our resources on one meal, we\\nshall be able to have a greater range of foods in the course of a week. A\\nhotel may have fifty or sixty items on its bill of fare, but after a few\\ndays one feels as if there were a great sameness, because all of them are\\nimpressed on the mind at each meal and every day.\\nDietaries.—A dietary, as we shall use the term\\nhere,[19]\\nis a statement\\nof the food requirements of a person or group of persons for a day or some\\nother definite length of time, with a selection of foods to satisfy this\\nrequirement.\\nThe first part of a family dietary will have to be calculated according to\\nthe age, weight, and occupation, as stated on pages 299-303.

With this addition we are still slightly deficient in total\\nenergy, but to add one or two hundred Calories is a very simple matter. A\\nsecond serving of potatoes, an extra roll for those whose fuel requirement\\nis highest, or a slightly more liberal use of butter, might well solve the\\nproblem. This dietary calculation shows how the menu may help in getting a\\nbalanced diet, and how knowledge of food values can be applied as a check\\non the menu. If we had had fewer dishes in each meal, we should have had\\nto plan to serve larger portions of some or all of them, or to use more\\nfreely such staples as bread, butter, and milk.\\nEach family must find out the kind of menu best suited to its resources.\\nSome typical meal plans suitable for everyday use are given below.',\n",

       " 'More elaborate plans than these should usually be reserved for\\nstate occasions.\\nThe cost of the dietary.—The types of menu used will depend very largely\\nupon the income of the family. It is comparatively easy to plan attractive\\nbills of fare if one does not have to consider the amount of work involved\\nin preparing them, or the cost of the materials to be used. With knowledge\\nof food values an expensive dietary may be wholesome, but there is great\\ntemptation to overeating and waste of food, and it is wise to keep meals\\nsimple for the sake of good digestion. Most families have to consider\\ncarefully the cost of food if any money is to be saved for books or travel\\nor emergencies. A dietary such as planned on page 313 will probably cost\\nfrom $1.50 to $2.00 for the day, or from 11⁄2 to 2 cents per 100\\nCalories, depending on the locality. Nothing is allowed for waste, which\\nmay, if the cook and those who eat the food are not careful, amount to\\nfrom 10 to\\n15316\\nper cent of the total cost. It is often estimated that the\\n“average” man will consume about 3000 Calories per day, and the cost may\\nbe expressed on this basis as from 45 to 60 cents per man per day; or the\\ndietary spoken of as a 45-cent or 60-cent dietary or whatever the exact\\ncost per 3000 Calories may be. The cost of food for such a family for a\\nyear would at this rate be from $550 to $750.\\nIf the allowance for food be placed at 25 per cent of the total\\nincome,[22]\\nthis dietary would be appropriate for a family with an income\\nof $2200 to $3000 per year. The majority of families have to get along\\nwith a lower expenditure for food, yet they want to be well nourished and\\nto enjoy their fare. Fortunately there is no real connection between cost\\nand nutritive value, some of the most nutritious foods being among the\\ncheapest. At the same time, we cannot get wholesome food for nothing.\\nThere are very few foods which to-day cost less than 1⁄3 of a cent per 100\\nCalories, and these are mostly cereal products, such as cornmeal, rolled\\noats, and flour, or sugars and molasses. These alone will not make a\\nwell-balanced, palatable dietary, though they will supply all the fuel\\nneeded for an “average” man for a day for ten cents. In many parts of the\\ncountry to-day it is hardly possible to make a dietary satisfactory week\\nin and week out with an average allowance of less than 3⁄4 of a cent per\\n100 Calories, and even this sum will prove satisfactory only provided\\nthere be skill in food preparation as well as food selection. With an\\nallowance of 1 cent per 100 Calories it is possible almost anywhere to\\nmake a balanced dietary with some attractiveness in appearance and flavor.\\nIn318\\nchoosing foods with regard to cost a table that shows which are cheap\\nfuel and which dear, is a great help. Prices vary so much with place and\\nseason that it is difficult to make one which is very exact, and some\\nrearrangement to suit any particular region may be necessary.

If the case is so severe as to demand a trained\\nnurse, she will have charge of the feeding, under the physician’s\\nguidance.319\\nMany times, however, a member of the family is temporarily\\nindisposed and needs food different from the ordinary family bill of fare.\\nIt is well to remember that in the first day or two of illness, fasting or\\ntaking of very little food does no harm, and may be an excellent help\\ntoward recovery, as it gives the digestive tract a chance to rest, if it\\nhas been disturbed.\\nNevertheless, the internal work of the body goes on, 0.4 Calorie per pound\\nper hour being expended during sleep, and about 0.6 Calorie per pound per\\nhour during waking hours in bed. A person in bed for twenty-four hours\\nwill require about 0.5 Calorie per pound per hour to prevent use of body\\nmaterial for fuel. A man of average weight, lying in bed, will thus need\\nabout 1850 calories per day. Hence we must see to it, that after a person\\nhas been sick for more than a few days (during which he can afford to burn\\nbody fat) enough fuel is given to satisfy his energy requirements if he\\ncan possibly digest it.\\nFood for an invalid must always be given in its most digestible forms.\\nMilk is one of the most valuable foods in sickness, not only because it\\nsupplies so many body needs, but because it can be used in so many\\nways,—hot, or cold, flavored or plain, made into junkets or sherbets,\\ncombined with eggs in eggnogs and custards, fermented as in kumyss or\\nsoured as in buttermilk or zoolak. In some form or other milk can almost\\nalways be made digestible. Eggs are also of great value, not only poached\\nor dropped and served on toast, but as dainty omelets, or in beverages, as\\neggnog, egg lemonade, and orangeade. Mild fruit juices, as orange, grape,\\nor pineapple, are not only refreshing but of considerable fuel value. If\\nthere is no fever, chicken, lamb chops, tender broiled steak or roast beef\\nmay serve to add variety to the menu. Broths stimulate the appetite and\\nhelp\\ndigestion,320\\nthough they are of little or no food value themselves.\\nCereals, eggs, and milk may be added to increase their food value. Cereals\\nin the form of gruels or delicate puddings, as cornstarch blancmange and\\ntapioca cream, are easily digested. Vegetables are best given rather\\nsparingly, and only delicate, mild-flavored ones, such as spinach or\\nasparagus, if digestion is much disturbed. In getting an invalid to take\\nsufficient food, much depends upon the attractiveness of the service.\\nRemember that very little things, like a fingermark on a glass, or coffee\\nspilled into the saucer, may take away appetite and prevent enough food\\nbeing eaten. Food in small quantities and taken at more frequent intervals\\nthan in health helps towards the best results.

       " '321\\nCHAPTER XIX\\nTHE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET\\nThe divisions of the income for which we should provide are food, shelter,\\nincluding taxes and operating expenses, clothing, and the “higher life,”\\nincluding recreation, education, and savings. The size of the income\\ndetermines largely the proportion of money allotted to each division. We\\nmust be nourished and protected from the elements by shelter and clothing,\\nand an income must at least provide for these necessities to be a living\\nwage. Yet we justly claim something more from our income than mere\\nexistence.\\nIn most families there is a fairly definite income. When the amount is not\\nknown it is wise to estimate upon the minimum income and have a surplus,\\nrather than to expend too much. Seventy-five years ago things cost less\\nand incomes were less, to-day the incomes have increased and cost of\\nliving is growing higher. The question is one to be studied relatively,\\nand the cost of living will depend on the ratio between income and one’s\\nmethods of living.\\nJust what other satisfactions than the merely physical are to be gratified\\nis the great question for the woman who divides the income. The problem is\\nnaturally hardest with the smallest income, where the “must be” crowds out\\nthe “may be.” But there is room for choice even with the small wage.\\nThis work of dividing the income and deciding on the ideals should be\\nshared by the family. When the home is first started the husband and wife\\nshould discuss frankly the\\nproblems322\\nof division and should agree on the\\nmethods of expenditure. This common understanding between members of a\\nfamily forms a bond of union, and each feels a greater pleasure and pride\\nin doing his part. The fact that there is a budget and a system brings\\norderliness in methods of work and freedom from worry and anxiety as well\\nas a saving of money. And this saving of money and strength is the same as\\nan increase in income. This budget or division of expenses acts as a\\nsailing chart and can be referred to from month to month. It should not,\\nhowever, become a burden, and one should not worry if every penny is not\\naccounted for.\\nStatisticians tell us that about 75 per cent of the male adults of our\\ncountry earn somewhat less than $600 a year. That in large cities $900 to\\n$1000 a year is necessary to bring up a family to live decently and enjoy\\nhuman happiness. Much depends upon how this income is divided as to\\nwhether results will tend to develop efficiency in the members of such a\\nfamily. As the income increases from $1000 to $5000 it is possible to\\napportion the income and indicate certain percentages which represent wise\\nfamily expenditures so as to include the higher intellectual and emotional\\nlife as well as the physical welfare of the family.\\nFrom comparison of many budgets statisticians have worked out certain\\npercentages that are helpful in making our decisions, although they are\\nnot to be taken as fixed rules.\\nExpenditure for food.—On examining the budgets of families having incomes\\nfrom $500 to $5000, it is found that the percentage spent for food\\nincreases as the income decreases, amounting sometimes to at least 50 per\\ncent of the income. This means that there is a limit to the money spent\\nper capita per day for food, below which we cannot go and maintain life\\nwith even sufficient efficiency for unskilled labor. Figure 77 shows that\\na $900 income gives about 45 per cent\\nto323\\nfood. An expenditure of thirty\\ncents per capita per day for food in a family of five with an income of\\n$1500, is 36.5 per cent; i.e. more than one third of the total income.\\nSuggestions as to allowance for food in families of different incomes are\\ncontained in the tables of budgets given farther on in this chapter.',\n",

       " 'Thrift in buying and using is necessary with the small\\nincome,324\\nand highly\\nimportant with the larger where we are prone to yield to a foolish impulse\\nto please a whim of the palate.\\nExpenditure for shelter.—The increased cost of building and the general\\nadvance in rentals make the expenditure for shelter a large one.\\nThe question whether homes should be owned or rented is a vital one.\\nOwnership is possible for comparatively few, but there is probably nothing\\nthat contributes more to the upbuilding of a community and the development\\nof good citizenship than the permanent residence of families in\\nlocalities. The pride of the members is enlisted in the home, its\\nsurroundings and general community welfare. This sense of ownership makes\\na house more a home although real home spirit is not confined to\\nownership of buildings. There are of course advantages and disadvantages\\nof ownership, and these should be carefully weighed. Preference for fresh\\nair, more space, less crowded conditions even if they necessitate daily\\ntravel, have driven people of limited incomes and certain ideals from the\\ncrowded cities to the suburbs in search of homes. When it is possible it\\nis certainly much more advantageous to own than to rent a home, when\\nliving means the attainment of certain ideals in the lives of the members\\nof the family.\\nIn deciding upon the proper expenditure, we must take into account the\\nlocation, whether convenient to business, school, and church, sanitary\\nconditions in surroundings and in the house or apartment, the appearance\\nof the house and the attractiveness of the neighborhood as well as its\\nconvenience and healthfulness. The house should be adapted to the needs of\\nthe family and selected with this thought in mind. See the companion\\nvolume, “Shelter and Clothing,” Chapters II and III.\\nIt has been estimated that 20 per cent of incomes\\nranging325\\nfrom $500 to\\n$5000 will secure a home, not including operating expenses, with the\\nproper sanitary conditions and one which will contribute to a right\\nstandard of living. If necessary to secure healthful surroundings more\\nthan 20 per cent may need to be spent, but 25 per cent of the income is\\nthe limit of the amount to be spent upon rent unless this also includes\\nheat (as in many apartments) when as much as 28 per cent may be so spent.\\nIf more than this is paid, it is practically impossible to avoid debt when\\nany unforeseen contingency arises. One thrifty German woman used 30 per\\ncent of the small family income for rent, in order to have more bedrooms\\nthan most tenement-house dwellers can afford. She did make ends meet by\\nworking until midnight at the family sewing, and tailoring; but though she\\nwas the very soul of thrift in regard to food, and had never called in a\\ndoctor, she could not save money until the children began to earn.\\nOperating expenses.—The question of operating expense is closely\\nassociated with the selection of shelter and should be carefully\\nconsidered with it in the division of the income. They are the expenses\\nnecessary to keep the house clean, warm, lighted, insured, and in constant\\nrepair. To these must be added in a suburban community water tax, property\\ntax, perhaps even a fire tax.\\nIn city apartments, heat and hot water are often furnished, and this must\\nbe taken into account in deciding between apartment and house, and between\\nrenting and ownership.\\nLabor is an important item in the running of the house. The close\\nconnection of selecting and operating a home will be seen. Should the\\nadministrator divide the family income in such a way that little is left\\nfor operating, the little things of everyday life become a constant source\\nof worry.\\nThe questions of the number of rooms, and their\\ncare,326\\nrelative expense of\\nheating by furnace, steam, or hot water, the cost of regular service in\\nwages per week in order to attain one’s ideals, the cost of extra service,\\nthe lighting by gas, oil, or electricity are all problems of operating.\\nKnowledge of sanitary science will make the homemaker demand cleanliness\\nin her surroundings, quick disposal of waste, and the prompt removal of\\ndust. Much care in planning is necessary here in order that there may be\\nno leakage and that there may be the full share of comfort for each\\nmember.\\nFor the income of from $500 to $5000 it has been estimated that a\\nproportion of from 10 to 20 per cent must usually be spent for operating\\nin order to secure comfort. Much must necessarily depend upon the amount\\nof hired service required, which, in turn, depends largely upon whether\\nthe homemaker is to give her time chiefly to the care of her children or\\nchiefly to the conduct of the housework.\\nClothing.—A large proportion of the family income is spent on clothing. A\\nknowledge of textiles and of purchasing is necessary in order to do this\\nwisely and economically. Clothing is as necessary an expense as food, for\\nit conserves the heat which the food furnishes and thus maintains body\\ntemperature. Health is the main factor in efficiency, and health is\\npreserved by clothing which protects the body from sudden changes in\\ntemperatures, and conserves the energy for other purposes. Money should be\\nspent on clothing to secure health, but too often more than the right\\npercentage of income is expended because of love of display. The instinct\\nfor show, color, ornamentation is a primitive one, and the æsthetic “want”\\nis, in one sense, as real as the physical and should be considered in\\nexpenditures for this purpose. It is a duty to look well, but it is not\\nnecessary, nor does it show good sense, to sacrifice the health,\\nhappiness, and higher life of the family by economizing\\non327\\nfood and other\\nessentials in order to secure hats, shoes, gowns, and accessories that\\ncater to a mania for show. If the income be limited so that the essentials\\nof clothing only can be purchased, the margin of income which can be spent\\nfor pleasure may, if taste so dictates, be spent on clothing instead of\\npictures, books, or some recreation. That is a matter for the individual\\nor family to decide. In the typical budgets cited below it will be seen\\nthat the expenditure for clothing was usually between 10 and 18 per cent.\\nThe higher life.—There are other needs of family life for which money\\nmust be spent besides the material ones of food, shelter, and clothing. In\\nthe division of some family incomes little thought is given to this phase\\nof living. After the income reaches a certain amount, it is possible so to\\nplan that education, recreation, philanthropy, and savings all figure in\\nthe division of expenditures. Some writers say that 25 per cent of the\\nincome of $1000 to $5000 should be spent in this way. If thought is given\\nto this, it would mean opportunities for books, periodicals, lectures, and\\nmembership in societies; some travel and vacation, social clubs, theaters\\nand concerts; charity and church expenditures; life insurance and other\\nsavings. It is the idea of ownership of property, of homes, of possessions\\nof all kinds that has led from primitive living to advanced civilization.\\nAnd with advanced civilization comes the need for the higher life which\\nshould be satisfied and can be through wise division of funds. The choice\\nof things to satisfy this higher life rests with the individual; it may be\\nmusic, it may be the cultivation of altruistic feeling in the help given\\nto neighbors; it may be a bank account for some future good, or money\\nspent on excursions, lectures, or theater. Whatever it is, it satisfies\\nthe emotional, spiritual, and intellectual life of man and distinguishes\\nhim as one of advanced civilization.',\n",
       " '328\\nSavings.—Something should be saved yearly even if at first it is but\\nlittle. Small amounts put away regularly in a savings bank mount up to a\\nconsiderable sum at compound interest, for regular saving is the only kind\\nthat counts. Life and sickness insurance are other forms of saving.\\nAllowances.—Each member of the family should have a personal allowance,\\neven though it is small. One mother gave each of her children five cents a\\nweek, beginning at five years of age, and increasing a cent a week each\\nyear, until they were old enough to be trusted with more. Even at this age\\nopposite characteristics showed themselves. One boy saved his allowance\\nuntil he had a quarter to spend at one time; another was in debt before\\nthe end of the week. Each had a bank, and kept accounts, as well. It is\\nsometimes better for a child if he “earns” his allowances by performance\\nof such household duties as seem best adapted to promote his development.\\nSuggested and typical budgets.—In preparation for the division of one’s\\nincome it is helpful to study the budgets of other families or\\nindividuals. Mrs. Richards in her book on “The Cost of Living” gives a\\ntheoretical division of incomes, which is shown in the accompanying table\\nheaded Suggested Budgets. It is interesting to study this account and then\\nthose of families who have worked out their problems (either with or\\nwithout the preparation of definite budgets in advance) as shown in the\\ntable of Typical Budgets.\\nIn New York City it has been estimated by those studying the problems of\\nthe cost of living of to-day that it is impossible for the average family\\nof mother, father, and three children under 14 years to get food enough to\\nkeep the body in good condition with clothing and shelter to meet the most\\nurgent demands of decency for less than\\n$900.329\\nThis amount in other\\nlocalities would probably buy more. This means that in New York City for\\n$900 a family of five can have a very bare existence, and that with $1000\\nthis family can begin to maintain a decent standard of living unless there\\nis long sickness or other catastrophe. At $1200 a normal family standard\\ncan be maintained so as to preserve health, and so that the family will\\nhave opportunities to develop in a self-respecting manner. When one\\nconsiders that many families subsist on $500 or $600 a year, it is\\nnecessarily under conditions of shelter and with limitations of food and\\nclothing, not conducive to the best development.\\nSuggested\\nBudgets[23]',\n",

       " '332\\nCHAPTER XX\\nSYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT\\nThe housekeeper should learn to use the labor-saving devices for her\\nrecords that are now employed so largely in the world of business. This\\nequipment should include a desk with fittings for systematized and rapid\\nwork. A roll-top desk, with pigeonholes and drawers is convenient, but a\\nflat-topped desk with drawers below gives a larger space for writing,\\nalthough it has to be supplemented by boxes to take the place of\\npigeonholes. Such desks may be purchased for twenty dollars and upward, in\\nwoods to match other furniture. It is a pleasure to have artistic desk\\nfurnishings, but a large amount may be spent on these, and the desk still\\nbe unequipped for practical purposes.\\nFiles and loose-leaf books.—A card file is as advantageous to the\\nhousekeeper as to the business man. Some desks contain a place for the\\ncard file in the upper right-hand drawer.\\nGuide cards are furnished in several colors to indicate divisions of the\\nfile, and these are plain, or with printed numbers and letters. The record\\ncards also are made of several colors, to indicate different uses. The\\nsuggestions here cover only a few of the possibilities. Visit some office\\nfurnishing department or shop to see what an array of conveniences has\\nbeen devised for the dispatch of business. If you once form the habit, you\\nwill find new uses for the card file almost daily, and will keep on the\\ncards, addresses, engagements, cash accounts, shopping lists, inventories\\nof333\\nclothing and furnishings, menus and recipes. A loose-leaf book is\\npreferred by some people for inventories and accounts.\\nA letter file shaped like a pocketbook can be purchased for only\\ntwenty-five cents, and will serve the purpose for a small correspondence.\\nLarge files with guide cards are made for a larger correspondence.\\nThe small file will answer for filing bills and is useful also for\\nclippings. Some desks have bill files in the pigeonholes, and a letter\\nfile in one of the large drawers.\\nHave regular hours daily for attending to work at the desk, stated times\\nfor planning menus, making shopping lists, looking over the inventories,\\nrecording expenditures, and balancing accounts.\\nOrder in time and place are studied further in the chapter on Housewifery.\\nKeeping of accounts.—This has been called by many, drudgery and tedious\\nroutine. Many business men go through much such drudgery to attain their\\ngoals, why should not the housewife be willing to make a similar sacrifice\\nin her home for the sake of the service she is rendering the members of\\nher household? The aim in keeping the accounts is to register the amounts\\nspent for various purposes so that all phases of life will be considered\\nand so that the manager will be able to profit the second year because of\\nthe experience of the first year. This makes housekeeping interesting and\\nbusinesslike. The expenditure is made to produce the maximum of value\\nreceived and is accompanied by the greatest possible pleasure.\\nIn keeping accounts there should be some method of showing the receipts\\nand expenses, the income and the outgo, so that a balance can be made at\\nany time. The items should be so listed, too, that it is possible to tell\\nwhat expenditure has been made for any one item, as rent, or food, or\\nother334\\nnecessities. It is only in this way that the accounts become of\\nvalue for future use.\\nThere are many ways of keeping such accounts. The simplest one for the\\nhousewife is the best if it shows the points mentioned above. The envelope\\nsystem is used by some when the income is small, and a certain amount of\\nmoney according to budget plan is put in labeled envelopes for various\\npurposes, as rent, food, operating expenses, etc. As sums are drawn from\\nthe various envelopes, a slip of paper put in the particular envelope\\nregisters the amount drawn. It is easy at the end of the month to balance\\nthe accounts. This system necessitates the presence of a good deal of\\nmoney on hand, and sometimes of confusion of accounts, if money is\\nborrowed from one envelope for use in another.',\n",

The simplest form for the average young woman\\nor housewife can be kept in an ordinary blank book and the spaces ruled\\naccording to one’s need. The account book can be started in somewhat the\\nfollowing manner, with the dates of expenditures in the first column and\\nthe respective amounts opposite under\\ntheir335\\nproper heads. In this way it\\nis possible by using double pages of the blank book to keep all the items\\nfor each month in horizontal series. The columns for items of expenses\\nshould be ruled as needed, but it is desirable to keep them under as few\\nheads as will suffice to give the information which may be desired. The\\nuse of the double page is advisable, for then the outer edge of the\\nleft-hand page can be used for the dates of purchase and plenty of room\\nfor columns of expense left across the two pages. The total in the various\\ncolumns can be easily calculated at the end of the first month and a new\\nset of pages ruled for the second. The expenditures should be entered\\ndaily so as not to be forgotten. A slip of paper kept in one’s purse is of\\nhelp if amounts are jotted down while one is shopping. The totals for each\\nmonth should be entered in another part of the blank book.

       " 'Somewhere in the book there should be kept an account of the receipts from\\nall sources. The balance of the yearly expense account with the sheet of\\nreceipt can be easily made.\\nSome plan must be made for showing which purchases are paid for in cash,\\nand which are charged. A simple method is to record the articles charged,\\nwith the place, date, and price on a card in the card file in a division\\nkept for this purpose, and labeled “Purchases charged.” When the bill is\\nrendered, it can be checked up from these cards, and the purchases entered\\nin the permanent account book. The record in the account book gives thus\\nthe date of\\npayment,337\\nbut not the date of purchase, unless this is added\\ntoo. The date of purchase can be recorded in the inventory of household\\ngoods (see Chapter XXII).\\nThis simple method of keeping accounts enables one to look over the\\nmonthly and yearly expenses and to see if the expenditure is apportioned\\nto the different divisions as it should be. If some of the needs of the\\nphysical or intellectual life are being neglected, it should be possible\\nto cut down or readjust the next year to the satisfaction both of the\\nhousewife and of her family.\\nIt is wise for all girls before they have homes of their own to keep\\naccount of their own small incomes. In many families daughters are given\\nmoney for clothing and daily expenses. Some such system of keeping\\naccounts as the above can be used. It is astonishing in examining\\naccounts338\\nfor clothing, to see how few maintain a correct balance. One girl found,\\nby keeping accounts, that she spent entirely too much for hats and gloves\\nand did not have the proper underwear to protect her body and maintain the\\ncorrect temperature for health. Accounts help us to determine whether our\\nmethods of living measure up to the ideals or standards of life which we\\nhave established in order to live rightly.\\nMethods of payment.—Payment is either immediate, known as “spot cash,” or\\ndeferred. If deferred, the articles purchased are charged by the dealer,\\nand a bill rendered the first of each month. When a charge account is\\nopened, a good business reference must be given. According to another\\nsystem, articles may be paid for in installments,—that is, so much each\\nmonth, according to some agreement. Of this method it may be said that it\\nis unsafe, or at least unwise, always. Remember that more is always paid\\nin the end.\\nIn either case the payment may be made in bills, specie, or by checks;\\nalthough in ordinary shopping immediate payment is usually made in bills\\nand specie.\\nThe advantage of immediate payment is that the buyer spends only what she\\nhas, and does not count on future money. This method of payment enables\\none to keep the balance well in hand. It necessitates, however, keeping\\nbills and specie in the house, and in one’s pocketbook, with the\\npossibility of theft or loss; and cash payment takes more time in the\\nshop, with the long wait for change. Sending “collect on delivery”\\n(C.O.D.) is a way of making cash payment and saving time at the shop. Be\\nsure that in this case there is the exact change at home, and some one\\nready to receive the goods.\\nCharging goods makes for economy of time. If you\\ncan339\\nremember that an\\narticle charged means money spent, this is a safe plan. One careful buyer\\nsays that she is too optimistic to have a charge account; too sure that\\nwhile she has not cash enough to-day for something that she wants, she\\nwill surely have it by the first of next month.\\nThere is another method of payment introduced by a few large department\\nstores. The firm requires a monthly deposit at the first of each month and\\ncharges up purchases against this. This is good in so far that the\\ncustomer is spending money that he really has, but it restricts purchases\\nto that one shop, and this is inadvisable in the case of a small income.\\nThe bank account and check book.—Whether payment is immediate or\\ndeferred, payment by check is a great convenience. It saves time and is\\nalso a record of money paid.\\nSelect a bank, conveniently located, and recommended by a conservative\\nbusiness man. Take to the bank a letter of introduction, with the sum for\\ndeposit. The bank will record your signature, and give you a bank book in\\nwhich is recorded the amount deposited. A check book will be given you\\nthat contains blank checks, and provides for keeping account of deposits\\nand checks drawn. Each check has to be filled in, and signed with your\\nname exactly as recorded at the bank, when you make a payment. This must\\nbe recorded in the proper place when the check is made out, stating date,\\namount, and payee. The sums paid out are added, usually for every three\\nchecks, and this sum deducted from the deposit, and the balance carried\\nforward. In this way you may always know your balance in the bank,\\nprovided you are accurate. Great care must be taken to fill in the blank\\nspaces correctly so that the check cannot be easily altered by any one.\\nIf a check is made out to you, and you wish to cash it,\\nor340\\ndeposit it,\\nyou “indorse” it by writing your name on the back across the left-hand end\\nof the check. The name must be written exactly as it appears on the face\\nof the check. If by chance the name is misspelled, write it in with the\\ncorrect spelling below.\\nThe checks that you make out are indorsed by the payee in the same way,\\nand cannot be cashed until so indorsed. Therefore, if a check is lost in\\nthe mail, you do not lose the money. The bank should be notified to “stop\\npayment” on the lost check, and you can then send another check in place\\nof the first one.\\nWhen you wish bills or specie, you go to the bank and present to the\\npaying teller a check made out to “Cash” and signed by yourself. It is\\nwise not to make out or sign such a check until you reach the bank,\\nbecause if such a check is lost on the way, there is danger of its being\\ncashed by the finder.\\nOnce a month you should leave the book with the teller to be balanced. In\\na few days you may call for it, and will receive with it the checks that\\nyou have drawn, and that have been returned to the bank by the date to\\nwhich the book is balanced. These checks are called vouchers. With these\\nthere is also a list of the amounts showing the total paid out on them by\\nthe bank. Check up the vouchers with the list, then check up the vouchers\\nwith your check book to see if all in your check book had been returned to\\nthe bank by the date of balancing. If there are some still out, add that\\nsum to your check book balance, and then compare the bank book balance\\nwith your check book.\\nDeposits may be sent by mail, either with or without the check book. If\\nthe book is sent, it should go by registered mail. If you do not send the\\nbook, the bank will send a receipt, which you return with the book the\\nnext time\\nthe341\\nbalance is made.

       " '342\\nCHAPTER XXI\\nHOW TO BUY\\nThe first rule in good buying is to know standard quality in your intended\\npurchase, for then you need not be dependent upon the salesman. The second\\nis to know your own needs, that you may not be beguiled by the clever\\nadvertisement in the daily paper, or the well-displayed bargain, and will\\nnot need to ask the salesman’s advice about quantity. Keep lists of\\narticles needed in the card file, and make your shopping lists from these.\\nThe third rule is to apportion your purchases to your income and the\\ndivisions of your budget.\\nWhere to buy.—Patronize reliable firms. There are in any community shops\\nof different grades, and you will not find the best return for your money\\nalways at those houses where there is the greatest parade of cut prices\\nand bargains. In the end the reliable places are the cheapest. Sometimes a\\nfirm trades on its reputation and a degree of fashion it has attained, but\\non the whole it is true that if one house has goods uniformly cheaper than\\nanother, it is because the quality is inferior.\\nOne fact that a good shopper learns is this—that certain articles may be\\npurchased to greater advantage at one place than another. One firm excels\\nin silks, another in household linen, another in coffee, and so on.\\nAlmost every community now has a “white list” and a branch of the\\nConsumers’ League, the significance of which was explained in “Shelter and\\nClothing,” p. 202.',\n",
       " '343\\nHow to shop.—Know the shops you patronize, first by personal inspection,\\nunless, of course, you are ordering from a distance.\\nMail orders and the telephone are helps to the buyer. These should not\\nentirely take the place of personal visits to the shops, but, if well\\nused, save many weary hours. The parcel post makes possible buying by mail\\neven perishable articles direct from the producer. Many country dwellers\\ndo a large part of their shopping even for clothing and furniture by mail,\\nand there are reputable firms who cater largely to this trade, and send\\nout well-illustrated price lists as guides. However, this method should be\\nused very cautiously, and it may be unsatisfactory for articles where the\\næsthetic element is important, as well as the quality.\\nBargains, sales, and advertisements.—Here the buyer matches her wit\\nagainst the wiles of the seller. Bargain sales may be made up of sweat\\nshop goods. Many women ignorant of textile production, flock to the sales\\nof materials and garments, helping the storekeeper to dispose of silk\\nwhich is rotting on his shelves, or garments which have been poorly or\\ncheaply constructed and which go to pieces the first time laundered.\\nRemnants are often cut from materials on the regular shelves, and\\nsometimes are offered at an advance in price at the so-called bargain\\nsales. In reliable shops one can sometimes find bargains during clearance\\nsales. It pays to wait and buy out of season, as much can be saved in this\\nway. A “best” hat in January, or a white dress in August, may often be\\npurchased to advantage. In order to do this, one must plan the wardrobe\\nsystematically.\\nTrading stamps and prizes.—Remember that nothing is given away, and\\nthat you pay for everything that you receive. It is well to deal with a\\nfirm that sells standard goods at standard prices. A discount is sometimes\\nallowed for cash.',\n",
       " '344\\nBuying on installments.—Methods of payment are discussed in Chapter XX.\\nThe installment plan is important to consider, since it is so common for\\npeople of small means. How tempting for a young couple, who have no\\nsavings, to furnish the new home in this way? It is a “gambling on\\nfutures,” however, as much as are some methods in the Stock Exchange. If\\nthe income stops, because the position is lost, or if sickness comes, and\\nthe installments cannot be paid, the whole outfit may be lost. There have\\nbeen real household tragedies of this kind. The better way is to save\\nuntil a small amount of simple furniture can be purchased outright. The\\ninstallment method is also used by established firms of sound reputation\\nto tempt one to buy the latest encyclopædia, or the new musical\\ninstrument, or some other much-desired possession. This is safe if one is\\nabsolutely sure of a fixed future income; but here again it is better to\\nsave first and buy outright. You may say that the installment plan gives\\nthe use of the encyclopædia at once, and this is true. But if you have the\\nsaving habit, there will already be a fund on which to draw.\\nThe ethics of shopping.—There is no greater test of good breeding and\\nkindness than the tour of a crowded shop; and sometimes the silken thread\\nis strained to the snapping point. Remember that tired human beings are at\\nthe counter.\\nTime your shopping that you may not help to crowd business at the closing\\nhour. If the shop closes at five, leave several minutes before the hour.\\nAs a matter of fact it is only to the shopper that the shop closes at the\\nstated hour; some of the hardest work of the day comes after hours. Avoid\\nshopping at the luncheon hour, and on Saturday afternoon at the time of\\nthe week when the salespeople are most tired. This is also a hard time for\\ndelivery men and boys. Consult here the pamphlets of the Consumers’\\nLeague.',\n",
       " '345\\nIn times of stress, the shopkeeper asks you to carry small bundles home\\nwith you, and this you should cheerfully do. Some women carry the C.O.D.\\nprivilege to an extreme, ordering in this way with the intention of\\nsending certain articles back, thus creating much unnecessary labor.\\nPurchasing of clothing and household textiles.—Experience is a good\\nteacher, but knowledge so gained is often paid for at high price. It seems\\nan easier way, with much saving of time, money, and energy, for girls to\\nlearn beforehand what to guard against in purchasing their household\\ntextiles for both clothing and furnishings. Our great-grandmothers were\\nsure their household textiles would wear, for they followed every step of\\ntheir manufacture and knew they were durable and honest. Conditions\\nchanged with the factory system of manufacture, and to-day women know very\\nlittle about textile fabrics or the making of garments. This ignorance of\\nmanufacturing processes results in the increased cost of living by the\\nwasteful expenditures made for household textiles. Women rely on the\\ninformation given by clerks in stores, often to their sad disadvantage. As\\nwe have learned, about 15 to 20 per cent of the family income is usually\\nspent on clothing and household furnishings for a family of four. Is it\\nnot necessary then that girls should learn to make the dollars earned buy\\njust as much as possible?\\nThere is need of a pure textile law in order that the adulterations of\\ntextiles may be defined. Some of us cannot afford to buy pure linen or all\\nwool, but we do wish to know the percentage of adulterant in order that we\\nmay judge whether the materials will meet our needs. It is beyond the\\npower of women now to control the making of fabrics, and the government,\\ntherefore, must help to maintain standards and proper supervision of\\ntextile labeling. Women can, however, study this problem, and with a\\nknowledge of\\nthe346\\nmanufacture and composition of textiles will come the\\npower to choose wisely, for manufacturers have been able to perpetuate\\nthese frauds chiefly because of ignorance.

French designs are the most beautiful in\\ndamasks, Scotch and Irish are good, and German patterns perhaps\\nthe least attractive. Weave often affects the wearing quality of\\nlinen as well as the appearance. The satin stripes and long\\nthreads on surface are apt to wear off quickly and they are\\nsometimes introduced to cover defects beneath. They cannot stand\\nheavy ironing as the closer, more even, weaves.\\n2. Linen is sometimes adulterated with cotton; if bought as\\nunion goods one may expect it. If bought for pure linen, ravel\\nthe material and untwist warp and woof threads. Do the threads\\nappear long and lustrous? The round threads are best. If cotton\\nhas been used, the ends will fly apart and fuzz, if linen they\\nwill appear more parallel and pointed at the ends when\\nseparated. The cheaper “all linens” are sometimes made from the\\ntow or short refuse. If the fiber is short, it will not last as\\nwell as the long. Moistening with the finger was an\\nold-fashioned test. A better one is to use a drop of olive oil.\\nThis test must be made at home. Water spreads more rapidly on\\nlinen than on cotton. The oil makes the linen fibers more\\ntranslucent than cotton.\\n3. Cost is a guide. Linen is expensive. Is the price that which\\nshould insure a good article? If cheap, beware.\\n4. Feel the cloth. Is it cold and does it feel rather heavy when\\ncrushed in the hand? Many buyers in department stores judge by\\nweight. In purchasing table linen less than 41⁄2 oz. to the\\nsquare yard is not worth buying. Above that it improves.\\nReliable firms will tell the weight. Custom house inspectors\\njudge by the picks or throws of woof to the inch.\\n5. Notice the finish. Is it full of starch and sizing which can\\nbe picked off? If so, in washing that will all disappear,\\nleaving a loosely woven instead of a smooth satiny surface.\\nCalendering and beetling make the material smooth and lustrous\\nand reduce the thickness. Do not be deceived. It is better to\\nbuy a soft linen than one stiff with starch which will crack.',\n",
       " '347\\n6. In buying table linen the goods received in December and\\nJanuary are apt to be the bleach of the previous summer.\\nRemember that poor bleaching affects the wearing quality. One\\ncan sometimes tell by tearing a sample.\\nFor quality, beauty, and variety of patterns, Scotch, French,\\nand Irish linens are the best. German damask is excellent. The\\nunbleached will wear much longer, is less expensive, and is\\nbought by many housewives and bleached as used.\\nDamask by the yard for tablecloths is slightly cheaper.\\nTablecloths from 21⁄2 to 3 yards are good size for a medium\\nfamily of five or six. One dollar a yard is a fair price for\\neveryday linen. The cloth should about equal 1 dozen napkins in\\ncost, and a cloth will usually wear as long as 11⁄2 to 2 dozen\\nnapkins. Napkins come in three sizes, 5⁄8, 17-22 inches; 3⁄4,\\n23-27 inches; 7⁄8, 29-31 inches.\\n7. For family towels, huckaback is the most serviceable,\\nalthough damask is used a great deal (see Fig. 78). Linen towels\\nvary in price from three dollars a dozen up, according to size\\nand quality. Dish towels of linen crash are very serviceable.',\n",

       " '8. Bedding. Sheets can be purchased ready made in linen or\\ncotton in various sizes. If they are to be made at home, buy\\nsheeting that can be obtained for single, two thirds, or\\nfull-sized bed. If cotton, buy in bleached or unbleached\\ncondition. Purchase sheets which are long enough to fold over at\\nthe top and protect the blankets. There are several good brands\\nof cotton sheeting. “Fruit of the Loom” is one of the best\\nknown.\\nTubing for pillow cases may also be bought. It has no seams, and\\ncomes in several widths.\\n9. It is better to purchase a certain amount of new linen\\nannually and gradually supplement that worn than to wait and\\nhave all wear out at once.\\nSome things to remember in purchasing silk.\\n1. That pure silk is seldom manufactured. It is nearly always\\nweighted, and a large proportion of weighting is to be guarded\\nagainst, as it weakens the wearing quality. Up to 30 per cent is\\nnot harmful and helps the silk to take the dye. The fact that it\\nis heavy in the hand does not always mean that it is a good\\npiece of material and will wear well—the weight may be due to\\nartificial “weighting” and not silk. Choose rather a softer\\npliable silk.',\n",
       " '349\\n2. Try the test for strength with the thumb (see “Shelter and\\nClothing,” page 199) to see if the warp and woof threads are\\nequally strong, or stronger one way than the other. If the\\nlatter, it will not wear well.\\n3. Fray out the threads. Do they break easily? If so, the silk\\nis not of good quality. If the warp threads are weak, the silk\\nwill split across, if the woof is weak, the silk dress will go\\nin ribbons.\\n4. If you have time before purchasing, test a sample of silk by\\nburning. Place in a porcelain dish and heat gently for thirty\\nminutes. The silk will vanish and the weighting remain.\\nBurn the threads to see if there is cotton in warp or woof. Burn\\nend of sample. If it is the same shape after burned, it is\\nprobably weighted.\\n5. Close weaves wear better than more loosely woven ones and\\nsoft silks better than stiff. Guard against buying soft silks,\\nhowever, that are so woven as to pull in the seams when worn.\\n6. Are you buying material made of reeled or spun silk? Bargains\\nare seldom found at silk sales. Should you expect to find pure\\nsilk at 50 or 60 cents a yard or as many yards of silk thread B\\nas A on a spool? Remember that the demand for a cheap product\\nmeans the production of cheap products. Wear something else\\nrather than cheap silks.\\n7. Is the silk adulterated with mercerized cotton or artificial\\nsilk? Try the tests. (See “Shelter and Clothing,” page 196.)\\nSome things to remember in purchasing wool.\\n1. Wool mixed with cotton makes a cheaper fabric and should not\\nbe sold for all wool. It wears well, but is not as warm as all\\nwool. Garments made of it do not keep their shape as well.\\nWoolens are often adulterated in felting. Pull the closely woven\\nfabric apart and untwist the fibers to see if cotton is present.\\n2. The burning test will help in deciding on the composition.\\n(See “Shelter and Clothing,” page 198.)\\n3. A good woolen or worsted fabric can always be remade. The\\ninexpensive is not cheap unless you wish something which costs\\nlittle but does not look well or wear well. One should not\\nexpect to get blankets of all wool for two dollars a pair. They\\ncost five or six.\\n4. Shoddy is one kind of recovered wool and is used to\\ncheapen350\\ncost of all-wool material. It can be detected because of\\nshortness of the staple of wool, but when mixed is difficult to\\nsee.\\n5. The weave of material affects the wearing quality. A close\\ntwill weave is more durable than a basket weave.\\nSome things to remember about color.\\n1. Blue. Dark blue in woolen material or gingham usually fades\\nlittle. Light blue is not as durable in color.\\n2. Red. Woolen material of this color wears well and usually\\nfades little. Red cotton when washed looks less brilliant. It\\nsoon fades by washing.\\n3. Black and gray. Woolen materials of gray, white, and black\\nor in combination are generally satisfactory. Cotton materials\\nof gray or black are apt to show starch in washing.\\n4. Lavender. This is a poor color to buy. It fades easily in\\ncotton goods.\\n5. Pink. Fades with washing. If a deep shade be bought it may\\nbe satisfactory.\\n6. Green. Usually very unsatisfactory. In good high-priced\\nginghams it may not fade, but in cheap ones it is apt to turn\\nyellow.\\n7. Brown. Good usually in ginghams, but likely to fade in\\nwoolen materials.\\n8. See chapters on costume design and dressmaking in “Shelter\\nand Clothing,” for suggestions in relation to colors one should\\nwear.',\n",
       " 'The above brief suggestions must be considered in the light of\\nthe knowledge gained from the study of the chapters on textiles\\nin the companion volume, “Shelter and Clothing.”\\nIn purchasing any materials for clothing or household furnishings,\\nremember that demand causes production and those who are intelligent will\\nmake the right demands in the right places. Insist on the honest labeling\\nof goods and demand that for which you pay. Why should cotton\\nmanufacturers label handkerchiefs which are cotton “pure linen,” and sell\\nthem at ten cents? We too should know linen cannot be bought at that\\nprice. The United States government employs experts to examine the\\nstandards of textiles used in making army, navy, and other uniforms, and\\nwill accept\\nonly351\\nthose materials from the contracting manufacturers which\\nstand their tests.

This\\ndepartment of household management is a combination of sanitation and the\\neconomics of labor.\\nOrder in place.—Keep articles of a kind together conveniently arranged in\\nplaces set apart for them, these places to be easily accessible. Make an\\ninventory of household goods in a card file,—household linen, personal\\napparel, including lists of clothing put away for summer or winter,\\ndishes, and valuables. Each housekeeper must make a scheme that suits her\\nown needs, but a few suggestions may be helpful.',\n",
       " 'Keep bed linen and towels, piled preferably on shelves, near\\nbedrooms and bathrooms, marked and numbered. Put the clean\\nunderneath when they come from the laundry.\\nClothing should be kept in an orderly way by each member of\\nthe family. Winter clothing and furs should be cleansed for\\nputting away, protected from moths by wrapping in paper, hanging\\nin tar bags, putting in cedar chests, or in trunks with some\\nstrong odored substances,—moth balls or cedar oil. Camphor is\\ntoo expensive. Summer clothing should be washed and put away\\nunstarched and unironed.\\nDishes and silver should be carefully arranged in very\\ndefinite places, and counted often enough to keep account of\\nbreakage and loss.',\n",

The question must be differently answered for\\nthe woman who has a helper one day a week, or with one or two, or with a\\nlarge staff of workers. However, there should be some definite plan for\\nthe days of the week and the hours of the day, and some division of work\\namong the members of the family or between the family and paid helpers.\\nThe young people of the family should each have some regular piece of\\nwork, at least in their own rooms; and the paid helpers should have a\\ndefinite plan given them, including some hours to themselves, as regular\\nas possible. There are emergencies that upset even the most perfect\\nsystem, and these must be met as they come, but a fair amount of work at\\nregular times should be the system.\\n“Domestic service” is too large a social and economic problem to discuss\\nat length here. Miss Jane Addams calls it “belated industry,” meaning that\\nin domestic work we are far behind the productive industries of commerce\\nin organization. We are trying experiments in putting work out, and having\\nhelpers come in, and in time we may bring order out of chaos when\\nemployers and employees are all properly trained and have the right\\nrelation to each other.\\nProcesses of housewifery.—Good working equipment, including labor-saving\\napparatus, is an essential; and we must have knowledge of the effect of\\ndifferent cleansing materials on fabrics, wood, paint, glass, and metal.\\nEquipment.—Brooms should be made of pliable straw (broom corn), be\\nevenly made, with a light and comfortable handle.',\n",
       " '355\\nBrushes may include the whisk broom, soft brush of bristles both short\\nand long handled for floors, a long handled brush of wool or soft material\\nfor walls, ceilings, and cornices, a soft brush for furniture, a thin\\nbrush for radiators, a silver brush, and stiff scrubbing brush. The\\nvariety of brushes at a furnishing shop is very large, and interesting to\\nstudy. It is economy to buy good quality when you can, and if cleaned and\\nnot abused they last a long time. Wash the brushes in soapsuds and water,\\ndrain and dry before putting away. A bamboo beater is convenient. The\\ndustpan should have a narrow cover at the handle side, and a strong\\nhandle.\\nCarpet sweepers prevent dust from flying and are easy to use, but\\ninclined to wear off the pile of the carpet.\\nVacuum cleaners are a necessity in crowded city quarters, where we\\ncannot beat and shake dusty carpets and rugs out of windows, on the roof,\\nor in the street, on account of our neighbors. That we cannot all have\\nthem does not make them less necessary. While they may involve no less\\nmuscular exertion they remove dust and old dirt in a remarkable way from\\nfabrics, and are very useful for taking dirt from cracks in the floor and\\nwoodwork and from upholstered furniture. The principle of operation\\ndiffers with different makes, and some are less effective than others, but\\nthere are several patterns that do good work and are not expensive.\\nExperiment with one at the first opportunity. A room cleaned in this way\\nis markedly different in odor from a room that has been swept with a\\nbroom, even when this is well done.\\nA good vacuum cleaner must have an air conveying system, a separator or\\nother means of disposal of the material picked up, and a vacuum producer.\\nThey may be divided, according to the method employed, into those worked\\nby bellows, by fan, by rotary pump and piston pump. This is a problem to\\ntake to the class in physics.',\n",
       " '356\\nCleaning cloths.—Have a good supply of cheesecloth dusters, and heavier\\ncloth for work on the floors. A sponge and chamois are useful. The mop,\\nwhich is a cloth or fiber fabric on a handle, is something that we ought\\nto banish when we can, for it is hard to keep clean, and is a trap for\\nbacteria. A substitute for the common mop is a long handle with a cross\\nbar covered with corrugated rubber, which is held down on the cloth, and\\nrubbed back and forth but not fastened to the cloth. Avoid the use of\\nlinty old cloths, because the thread and lint clog the traps and drains.\\nCleaning cloths should be boiled in strong soap suds, rinsed, and\\nthoroughly dried before putting away. This is a difficult rule to enforce,\\nfor it is a temptation to tuck such things away where they will not show.\\nWatch this matter as you do the garbage pail. When a cloth is too dirty to\\nwash clean, burn it or send it away with paper refuse.\\nCleaning materials.—Air, sunshine, and water are the great purifiers,\\nplus muscular energy or the power of machinery, but we frequently use\\nchemical aids. These should all be kept in stock.',\n",
       " 'Soaps and alkalies.—White and yellow soap, some washing\\npowder, sal soda, caustic soda, household ammonia. Buy these in\\nquantities if you have room to store them, and if they will not\\nbe used too lavishly because the supply is large. The soap is\\nnot much cheaper by the box, but it hardens with age, and then\\nit wastes less rapidly when used.\\nOils and polishes.—Crude oil, kerosene, a mixture of linseed\\noil, vinegar, and turpentine, one part each, cottonseed oil,\\nalcohol.\\nAcids.—A solution of oxalic acid marked poison. Vinegar is on\\nhand among kitchen supplies.\\nGritty substances.—Rotten stone, whiting, some gritty soap of\\na kind that does not scratch, a gritty powder, or fine sand for\\ncoarse work.\\nDisinfectant and deodorizers.—A weak solution of carbolic\\nacid357\\nmarked poison, chloride of lime, or some reliable\\npreparation[26]\\n(though these are rather expensive), rock salt,\\nand coarse common salt.\\nMethods of cleaning.—We must first consider what the substance is that\\nhas to be removed. The fabrics and upholstery used in furnishing catch\\ndust which contains lint, grit, organic material from our bodies, and\\nbacteria. Fabrics also become spotted (see next chapter). The walls and\\nceilings, floors and cracks, catch dust. All wood and glass surfaces\\nbecome soiled from the touch of even clean fingers, and the moisture of\\nthe air mixed with dust dulls them. Metal surfaces oxidize, and this\\noxidized layer must be rubbed off.',\n",
       " 'To clean fabrics.—If you live in a suburb or in the country,\\nbrush, shake, and beat articles to be cleaned out of doors,\\nnoticing the way of the wind that the dust may not be carried\\nback into the house.\\nTo cleanse a rug, spread it on the grass, rub with a medium\\nstiff brush with white soap solution on the wrong side, turn it\\nover, and rinse with water from the hose; or better still, tack\\nit by two corners to a wooden wall, and then wash with hose. The\\ncity dweller must resort to the vacuum cleaner, or rely upon a\\ncleaning establishment. The other alternative is to shake out\\nthe dust in the room, remove each article as it is cleaned, let\\nthe dust settle, and take it out as well as it can be. One\\napartment dweller heard this remark rise from the window below\\nher: “Shut the window quick. Those dirty people upstairs are\\nbrushing a rug out the window!”\\nPainted surfaces and woodwork should be wiped off with a soft\\ncloth wrung out of tepid water. A small amount of neutral white\\nsoap solution in the water can be used for paint if it is\\ngreasy, but alkalies are ruinous.\\nA highly polished surface (piano) is cleaned by washing\\nwith358\\na sponge and tepid water, and rubbing until dry with a wet\\nchamois wrung out of cold water. This method was learned from a\\npiano polisher, and it works excellently. A dry chamois streaks\\nthe surface.\\nThe wood of furniture is kept clean by rubbing with a soft dry\\ncloth, but once in a while needs cleaning with crude oil or the\\nmixture of oil, turpentine, and vinegar. Bureau drawers need\\nwatching for finger marks.\\nGlass is best cleaned by rubbing on a mixture of whiting and\\nwater. Leave it to dry and rub off with a dry cloth. A fine\\ngritty soap comes for this purpose. Ammonia and water and a soft\\ncloth work well, the success depending upon the final polishing.\\nVery soft tissue paper is satisfactory for polishing.\\nMarble, porcelain, and enamel need little more than white soap\\nsuds, rinsed off and the surface dried. If spotted, use the\\nfinest kind of metal soap.\\nMetals.—Fine silver and plated ware should be kept polished\\nby the daily careful washing, rinsing in hot water. Silver will\\nspot and tarnish. Use whiting and alcohol, let it dry on, and\\nrub off with a clean cloth or chamois.\\nThe silver powders sold at the silversmith’s are very good, but\\nthe patent powders and liquids should not be used, as they\\nremove too much of the silver.\\nBrass and copper are polished with rotten stone and oil. If\\nthe metal is spotted, use oxalic acid solution with the rotten\\nstone. After rubbing well, the metal should be washed off in hot\\nsoap suds and finished with a dry cloth.\\nNickel plate keeps bright if kept clean by daily dry rubbing.\\nCare of rooms.—The bedroom.—The daily care includes airing the room\\nand its closets, airing and making the bed, dusting, removing lint and\\nthreads from the floor, and removing slops and bringing fresh water if\\nbathing apparatus is in the room.',\n",
       " 'To make the bed.—The amount of airing of the bedclothes\\ndepends somewhat upon the weather; bed linen absorbs too much\\ndamp if placed by the window on a rainy or foggy day. Pull back\\nthe bedclothes and hang them over a chair set front to the foot\\nof359\\nthe bed, seeing that the bedclothes do not drag on the\\nfloor. On a bright, fresh day remove all the clothes and hang\\nthem singly near the window. If there is a screen in the room,\\nthis is convenient for this purpose. The blankets should be hung\\nout on the line once in a while, and washed twice a year. One\\nimportant point in the cleanliness of the bed is a pad or thick\\ncloth placed on the mattress under the sheet. The mattress\\nshould be sunned and aired often, and beaten or cleaned with the\\nvacuum cleaner.\\nTo make the bed, place the cover on the mattress, lay the under\\nsheet straight, tuck in firmly at top and bottom, and fold the\\nsides under straight, making angles at the corners. Put each\\npiece on separately, turning the upper sheet down over the\\nothers. The cover is sometimes placed over all, and a strip to\\nmatch over the pillows.\\nCare of the washstand.—This is all important, and cannot be\\nneglected a day, without causing an unpleasant odor. The jars\\ncontaining slops should be rinsed in cold water, washed out in\\nwarm soap suds, dried, and aired. If the ware is china, hot\\nwater may crackle the glaze, and then it is impossible to remove\\nodors. Wash and dry all the small articles and wipe out and\\nrefill the water pitcher.\\nCare of the bedroom at night.—Fold back, or remove the\\ncovers, and lay the bedclothes partly back. See that drinking\\nwater is in the room, and lighting conveniences.\\nThe living room, dining room, and halls.—The daily care consists in\\nsetting furniture and such small articles as the pictures and ornaments\\nstraight, removing lint and dust from the floor, dusting wherever needed.\\nThe weekly cleaning of all rooms.—Whether a thorough cleaning is needed\\nweekly, depends upon the situation of the house, and the number of people\\nwho use the rooms. The rooms in a country house set in wide green spaces\\ndo not need cleaning so often as those of a city house.',\n",

Cover what remains.\\nClean360\\nthe textile fabrics in the best way available. Brush the walls,\\nwith a special brush, or soft cloth on a broom. Dust and cover\\npictures.

Wash mirrors and the glass of\\npictures. This means much labor, and some people cannot\\naccomplish it every week; and different rooms should have\\ndifferent cleaning days. But such thorough cleaning occasionally\\nis necessary for keeping all articles in good condition and also\\nfor the health of the family.\\nThe old-fashioned yearly house cleaning seems hardly necessary\\nif cleaning is well done through the year, but in both fall and\\nspring some extra freshening may be necessary in the way of\\nthorough cleansing of textiles and furniture. All closets should\\nhave everything removed from them and the whole closet cleansed.\\nDrawers should come out, be emptied, washed and aired, and fresh\\nwhite or brown paper put in all.\\nThe bathroom and toilet.—This needs very particular care, no matter what\\nthe type may be. All drains and traps should be flushed daily, and a\\nsolution of caustic soda put down weekly. If there is an odor about the\\nwater closet, try salt first, and then some chloride preparation. The\\nbasin, the tub, and the seat and basin of the toilet should be thoroughly\\nwashed daily. When the bathroom is used by more than one person, all\\nshould be taught to leave all the toilet equipment perfectly clean. If the\\ntoilet is not of the water-closet type, even greater care should be taken.\\nEverything361\\nmust be kept scrubbed clean, and chloride of lime should be\\nput down daily, if there is not a removable pail with earth.

Wash off the lamp in warm soap suds, wash and\\npolish the chimney and shade, and replace. If you cannot get rid\\nof odor, take the burner apart, boil it in a solution of washing\\nsoda, and put in a new wick.

The matches used\\nshould be of the safety type. They should be blown out, never shaken, and\\nnever thrown into a basket of papers. When matches are used, always have a\\nsmall fire-proof receptacle in each room. Smokers are often careless in\\nregard to their matches, cigars, and pipes.

       " '365\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\nLAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING\\n“Washing is a necessity, ironing a luxury.” This terse sentence expresses\\nvery clearly the relative value of the two large divisions of the\\nlaundering process. The thorough washing of clothing is a most important\\nbranch of household sanitation, upon which the health of the family and of\\nthe whole community depends, for disease is communicable by means of\\nsoiled garments and those that are imperfectly cleansed in unsanitary\\nhouses and possibly in commercial laundries. The ideal city will have many\\nlarge and spotlessly clean laundries, where skilled labor intelligently\\ndirected will insure clothing as clean as it can possibly be made.\\nThere is an æsthetic element in laundering as well, for good washing\\nmethods give a tinted white to fabrics that it is a pleasure to see, and\\nironing makes a smoothness that is pleasant to the touch, and brings out\\nbeauty of design, as in damasks and embroideries. There is an economic\\nfeature, too, in that poor and rough methods of work in both washing and\\nironing injure fabrics and shorten their term of usableness.\\n“Washing Day” has an ill repute that it does not deserve, for laundering\\nis a science and an art that it is a pleasure to practice, if one has\\nskill. Make it one of the household arts which you must carefully study,\\nand you will find it pleasurable as well as necessary.\\nSoil in garments.—The dust and dirt of the street and house that soil our\\ngarments contain inorganic particles\\nof366\\nearth, lint from textiles,\\norganic matter from animals and human beings, and also bacteria. The\\nmaterial from our bodies consists of particles of skin, skin secretions,\\nand bacteria, which are collected in underwear and bed linen and towels.\\nSpots of grease and stains may fall upon our outer clothing, and fruit\\nstains affect table linen in particular.\\nCleansing agents.—Water is the great cleanser, and if it is not available\\nin abundance and used freely, the washing is a failure. All other agents\\nare merely aids to the water or substitutes for it. In primitive outdoor\\nmethods, still largely used in some countries, the flowing water is the\\nonly agent, and yet the result is fairly good. We aid the process by the\\nuse of soap or washing powders or ammonia.\\nThe air and sun are also purifiers, and clothing should be exposed to\\ntheir action for drying whenever possible. There is a sweetness in air and\\nsun-dried clothing that no artificial drier seems to give. Probably there\\ntakes place some oxidation of impurities present in very small amount and,\\nmoreover, any bacteria still clinging to the fabric may be killed by the\\nsun’s rays. Heat is a purifier, oily substances being more readily removed\\nby hot water and soap than by cold; and the boiling temperature of water\\nrenders bacteria and organic matter harmless.\\nSome mechanical action that forces water through the fabric is necessary,\\nand the method of accomplishing this is one of the important problems in\\nlaundering. We seek a method that will be thorough, that will not injure\\nthe fabric, and that will economize the muscular energy of the worker.\\nBeating, pounding, and rubbing are the old methods, the use of a machine\\nthe new, and that is the best machine that meets all the requirements of\\nthe properly conducted washing process as described below.\\nThe water should be soft and clean. Rain water is a\\nperfectly367\\nsoft\\nwater and excellent for laundering if the cistern is kept clean, and free\\nfrom the dust of the roof. Lake, river, and well water are sometimes soft.\\nStrainers may be used on the faucets if at any time the water from these\\nsources becomes muddy. (See Chapter V for discussion of soft and hard\\nwater.)\\nHard water prevents the soap from lathering, and this must be counteracted\\nfor laundering. Temporary hardness is removed by boiling. Permanent\\nhardness is not affected by boiling and can be overcome only by the\\naddition of some substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. Only enough of\\nthese should be used to allow the soap to do its work, since they may\\ninjure fabric and the skin of the worker.\\nSoap is the most useful of the cleansing agents added to water. It may\\nhave been accidentally made in the first place by some housewife who put a\\ngreasy pot to soak with a solution of lye made from the ashes of her\\nhearth fire. Heat and alkali break up the fat into two parts, glycerin and\\na fatty acid. The fatty acid combines with the alkali, giving soap, and\\nthe glycerin remains free. Both animal and vegetable fats are used, and\\ndifferent forms of alkali, usually potash or caustic soda, the former for\\nsoft, the latter for hard, soap.\\nIn these days soap is much better made in the factory than it can be at\\nhome. In the factory the alkali is proportioned by weight, so that as\\nlittle free alkali is left as possible. Such a soap is called “neutral.”\\nResin is added, in yellow laundry soaps, and is supposed to aid in forming\\nsuds. When there is an excess of resin, as in some cheap soaps, it is hard\\nto rinse out and colors the clothes. Borax is sometimes added to soap, and\\nis useful when the water is hard, but not necessary in soft water. Naphtha\\nor some other petroleum oil in soap increases the cleansing property of\\nsoap, by dissolving fatty or greasy impurities.',\n",
       " '368\\nA soap solution is essential for use in the boiler and in washing\\nmachines and is useful for rubbing on spots before washing.',\n",
       " 'To make soap solution, cut up the soap and dissolve it in hot\\nwater, one pound soap to one gallon of water. It should be\\nstrong enough to jelly when cool, and may be kept in jars ready\\nto use. Even more convenient are soap chips which come by the\\nbarrel, but may be bought at pound rates.\\nBleaching and bluing agents.—The sun, as it bleaches white fabrics, may\\nbe counted in this group. Chemical bleaches are used to whiten clothes,\\nbut should not be resorted to unless clothes are yellow from poor washing,\\nas in the end they weaken the fabric. Commercial laundries sometimes use\\nan excess of acid for this purpose. Cream of tartar is a harmless bleach.\\nJavelle water is another household bleach, chloride of lime being the\\nbleaching substance. This is also a good disinfectant.',\n",
       " 'To use cream of tartar.—Dissolve cream of tartar in hot\\nwater, 1 teaspoonful to each quart. After the yellowed fabrics\\nhave been thoroughly washed and rinsed, lay them overnight in a\\nsolution of this strength, rinse, blue, and dry in the morning.\\nJavelle water.—1⁄4 pound chloride of lime, 1 pound sal soda,\\n2 quarts of cold water. Dissolve the chloride in half the water\\ncold, and the sal soda in the other half boiling. Stir together\\nthoroughly, allow the mixture to stand several hours, pour off\\nthe clear water with care, and bottle it. Use a tablespoonful of\\nthe solution to a gallon of water, and heat the yellow fabric in\\nthis mixture after thorough washing, for half an hour, not\\nallowing the temperature to rise above 100° F. Rinse very\\nthoroughly before bluing and drying.\\nBluing is used to neutralize the slightly yellowish tint of the fabric,\\nwhen it cannot be completely bleached.',\n",
       " 'Ultramarine blue is sold in small balls and cakes.\\nAniline blue is a strong color, and in a very dilute solution\\ngives369\\na pleasing pearly tint to the fabric, especially when the\\nviolet tint is used. Mix an ounce of the blue with one gallon\\nwater, and bottle for use.\\nPrussian blue is to be avoided, since it is a salt of iron, and\\noften yellows or spots the clothes. It is usually sold in liquid\\nform. To test, mix the liquid blue with a strong solution of\\nwashing soda and heat. If the mixture turns red, and there is a\\nreddish precipitate, the blue is this salt of iron.\\nStarch is used to fill the interstices of fabrics and give a smoothness\\nand stiffness to the cloth that prevents the rumpling of garments. Both\\nwheat and cornstarch are used for laundry purposes when only the natural\\nstarches are available, the wheat starch being better for home laundering,\\nas the cornstarch gives a quality that is too stiff and crackling.\\nRecently, however, the manufacturers have learned to make “thin boiling”\\nstarches from corn and have placed on the market a variety of such\\nmodifications of cornstarch for laundry use. Rice starch or “rice water”\\nis used for very thin muslins.',\n",
       " 'To make starch.—For method of making, see starch experiments,\\nChapter VIII. The starch must be perfectly smooth, and should be\\nstirred while it is boiling for a few minutes, and strained.\\nProportions.\\n1. For lingerie, 1 teaspoonful of starch to 1 quart water.\\n2. For medium fabrics, 11⁄2 to 3 tablespoonfuls starch to 1\\nquart water.\\n3. For stiff work, 5 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart water.\\nIroning.—The ironing process is the most difficult art in laundering, and\\nrequires good tools, practice, and patience. In the summer it is an\\nexhausting labor unless an electric or gas iron is available. Much energy\\nmay be saved in hot weather by omitting the ironing of certain articles.\\nDish towels, even toilet towels, and soft underwear may be stretched and\\nfolded, and are perfectly comfortable to\\nuse.370\\nSome women who do their own\\nwork even fold sheets and pillow cases without ironing.\\nThe smoothing of the fabric is accomplished by heated irons, or by\\npressing between rollers in a mangle.\\nTo summarize.—The essential steps in laundering are: the forcing of\\nclear water through the fabric; loosening of the soil and stains by soap\\nand appropriate chemicals, sterilization by boiling temperature, drying\\nand sweetening in the air if possible. The less essential are bluing,\\nstarching, and in some cases ironing.\\nLaundry equipment.—We are beginning to realize that a separate room for\\nlaundering purposes is an essential in a well-equipped home. Such a\\nlaundry will be light and well ventilated, will have washable floors,\\nwalls, and ceilings, running water and hot water supply, sanitary tubs and\\nconveniences in the shape of machinery. We shall not have perfect\\nlaundries until electric power is available at a fair price. Much is said\\nabout electricity on the farm, and the progressive farmer who has his own\\nengine should not fail to use the power for all laundry work. Trolley\\npower should be available, and this use of electricity should be made\\ncooperative when practicable. In a few communities abroad and at home, the\\npower available in a creamery is used for laundering purposes as well.\\nWhere there cannot be a separate laundry, take pains to have the equipment\\nas good as space will allow.',\n",
       " 'The tubs.—If possible, have three tubs, for this makes for\\neconomy of time. Enameled tubs are the most sanitary, and be\\nsure that they are white. You cannot tell whether or not the\\nclothes are clean and blued to the proper tint in a buff-tinted\\ntub, which you may be tempted to buy because it is cheaper.\\nRound portable tubs, to be set upon a bench, should be of\\ngalvanized iron, which is sanitary and light. Wooden tubs are\\nthings of the past, unsanitary and heavy.',\n",
       " '371\\nEquipment for forcing water.—The rubbing board is the old-time\\nmethod, yet it wears the fabric and wears out the worker, and\\nshould be used as little as possible. If still considered\\nnecessary, it should be of glass set in wood. The wooden board\\nis unsanitary and the metal board may at any moment develop a\\ntiny crack that will tear the fabric.\\nFortunately, many women are learning that the washing machine,\\nproperly used, is a great economy of fabric, time, and strength.\\nMany machines are on the market, and we need to discriminate and\\nto select the machine constructed to force the water through the\\nfabric without injury to the fabric, and with the smallest\\namount of muscular energy and that properly exerted without\\nstrain. Of course, if machine power is available, the problem is\\neasy. These many washers may be classed in four groups. One is a\\nrevolving arrangement, sometimes consisting of two corrugated\\nboards set in the center of a tub of clothes, one objection\\nbeing that the clothes are sometimes torn. Another type has a\\nrevolving perforated inner cylinder for the clothes, and an\\nouter one for the soap and water. This is much more expensive.\\nStill a third rocks the clothes in soap and water and is very\\neffective. A fourth type makes use of suction.\\nThe principle of cleansing by pressure and suction is used in\\nseveral machines and hand washers, and these are, on the whole,\\ninexpensive and practical for home work. The work is\\naccomplished by an inverted cone, pushed down on the clothes,\\nand lifted. Such a washer is seen standing on the floor in Fig.\\n80. The same figure also shows another of this type standing on\\nthe table, and still another to be used in the boiler.\\nMost of these devices can be used with power.\\nThe boiler.—A portable boiler is convenient. It should be made\\nof good quality tin with copper bottom and must be thoroughly\\nwashed and dried after using.\\nThe wringer is of great assistance to good work. It should be a\\ngood machine having hard rubber rollers, ball-bearing action,\\nand strong springs at the side. It must be cleaned after using,\\ndried, the pressure loosened, and the whole kept covered.\\nThe drier.—If clothesline or heavy wire is used, this must be\\nof good quality, and well cared for. The clothesline should be\\ntaken in after each using. A revolving drier is convenient, and\\nmay\\neven373\\nbe used in apartment houses. The steam drier has a\\nrack on which clothes are hung, and economizes space and time.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 80.—Simple laundry equipment for the\\nhome. A. Fowler, Photographer.',\n",
       " 'Irons.—The hand iron is heated in several different ways. The\\nold-fashioned iron heated on the stove, and the electric iron\\nare the most satisfactory. In buying hand irons, select those of\\ngood weight, for this makes the work easier. Three or four will\\nsuffice for ordinary work, and they should weigh from 4 or 5 to\\n7 pounds. A small pointed iron is necessary for fine work, and\\nfor sleeves there is a special, narrow iron. The irons must be\\nkept clean, and perfectly dry when not in use. Wax tied in a\\ncloth is a good cleaner, and should be at hand during the\\nironing process. A stand is necessary on which the iron may\\nrest, and paper or cloth on which to rub the iron when it comes\\nfrom the stove.\\nElectric irons are proving very satisfactory, and although the\\nfirst cost is high, they should be used wherever possible.\\nThe mangle.—Small mangles, used either cold or heated, are now\\nmade for family use, and are great labor savers in flat work.\\nTowels and small flat pieces may even be put through the\\nwringer, while they are still damp, with very good effect.\\nThe ironing board.—This should be firm, well padded, and\\ncovered with clean cloth. The cover may be made to tie on so\\nthat it can be easily changed. Ironing boards should be placed\\nin a good light. Boards may be attached to the wall, and these\\nhave firm support. In a small room, the board can be made to\\nturn up.\\nOther apparatus.—A hamper or bag for soiled clothes, a basket\\nfor clean, pail and dipper, a clothes stick, a large pan, a\\nsmall and a large saucepan, a teakettle for boiling water, a\\nknife, wooden spoon, common spoons and measures, a sprinkler or\\nbrush for sprinkling clothes, a clotheshorse, clothes hangers\\nfor waists and dresses. The soiled clothes bag should be washed\\nweekly, and the hamper should have a removable lining also for\\nweekly washing.\\nMonday and Tuesday are the traditional days for washing and ironing, but\\nthe woman who does her own work, or perhaps has a helper, or one maid, may\\nfind it a good plan to do no more on Monday than the mending, removing of\\nstains, and sorting. This gives time to make the house orderly, after\\nSunday, and to prepare food, some of which may\\nlast374\\nover the next two\\ndays. Some of the clothes may then be soaked overnight.\\nOrder of work.—Mending, sorting the clothes, removing stains, soaking,\\nwashing, boiling, rinsing, bluing, starching, drying, sprinkling and\\nrolling, ironing, folding, airing, sorting, and distributing.\\nMethods.—Mending and removing spots from fabrics are discussed in\\n“Shelter and Clothing.” A few common stains are removed as follows:',\n",
       " 'Fruit and coffee stains.—Hold the spotted fabric tightly over\\na bowl and pour boiling water through it. Of course, remove\\nstains at once if possible.\\nPeach stains are removed by Javelle water. Apply a few drops\\nand pour boiling water through at once.\\nCocoa and chocolate stains are helped by borax, and by soap\\nand cold water.\\nInk.—Liquid ink removers provided for the library table are\\nconvenient. Wet the spot, use 1, dry with a blotter, and use 2,\\nand rinse at once. The same thing is done by wetting, applying\\nan oxalic acid solution first, then Javelle water and rinsing.\\nBlood stains are removed by soaking in lukewarm water, and\\nwashing in a soap solution with a little ammonia and kerosene,\\nor with a naphtha soap.\\nSorting.—Separate the fabrics, wool from cotton and so on, and\\ncolored cotton from white; also separate body linen from bed\\nlinen and from table linen.\\nSoaking.—This hastens the process since it loosens dirt, and\\none laboratory experiment seemed to show that soaked clothes are\\nfreer from bacteria, than those that are not.\\nShrinkable fabrics cannot be soaked. Body and table linen should\\nbe soaked separately. The water should be cold, softened with a\\nlittle ammonia.\\nWashing.—Wash woolens and silk underwear first, in warm, not\\nhot, soap suds, wring out, rinse, and hang to dry. Use a white,\\nneutral soap. Have the same temperature for both washing and\\nrinsing. Boiling water shrinks wool, and yellows silk. Hand-knit\\nwool, as shawls and jackets, stretch in drying. If dried in\\na375\\nbag or pillow case, this is partly obviated, or lay them on a\\npad on the table.\\nPrepare hot water in the tub, with dissolved soap in it, either\\nfor handwork or a washer. Wash table linen first, then bed linen\\nand towels, and next the body clothes. Soap the articles well,\\nand rub or use a washer. It is well to wash handkerchiefs by\\nthemselves, boiling in a pail for half an hour. If one of the\\nfamily has a cold or influenza, soak his handkerchiefs in a\\nsolution of salt and water and perhaps a little bleaching powder\\nbefore washing and boiling.\\nMake fresh suds often. This means heavy labor in the case of\\nportable tubs, but clothes cannot be cleansed in dirty water.\\nColored cotton and linen articles may be washed last. They\\nshould be put first into salt and water to set the color, washed\\nin tepid water with white soap, rinsed thoroughly and hung in\\nthe shade, wrong side out.\\nBoiling.—Boil the washed clothes in soap solution for ten\\nminutes. In case of infectious disease, all the patient’s linen\\nshould be boiled an\\nhour,[27]\\nand of course exposed clothing is\\nkept separate through the whole process.',\n",
       " 'Rinsing.—This must be thorough and two or three waters must be\\nused. This is the stage where many laundresses fail. The suction\\nwashers are very useful here.\\nWringing.—This must take place between every two stages of the\\nprocess.\\nBluing.—Add the bluing solution to clean water to the desired\\nshade, shake each piece, put it through the water, and wring out\\nat once. Do not use bluing in excess.\\nStarching.—Next the fabrics that need a little thin starch may\\nbe starched. Starch for stiff collars and shirts is rubbed in\\nat the time of ironing.\\nDrying.—Hang out the clothes, having pieces of a kind together,\\nand the threads straight. If out of doors, hang in such a way\\nthat the air will have easy access.\\nTake down, when dry, and fold lightly in a basket.\\nSprinkle, roll tightly, and leave them until ironing time.\\nThin fabrics should be very moist, as they dry quickly.',\n",

       " 'Commercial laundries.—The convenience of these has been suggested\\nalready. When we can make them all sanitary, and when methods are used\\nthat will not injure the fabric, we can safely put this kind of work out\\nof the house, but at present many commercial laundries are unsanitary and\\nruin the clothes.\\nCost of laundering.—We cannot have good service without paying for it,\\nand one cause of poor laundry work is the public demand for cheap work,\\nand this too has its effect upon the laundry worker. The housekeeper often\\nfails\\nto378\\nhave the laundry ready when the wagon calls, and yet demands a\\nquick return, which also results in poor work.\\nIf you have never done any laundering and expect a laundress to do up fine\\nlingerie at a low rate, it will be a revelation to you to attempt to iron\\na shirt waist or lingerie dress, and then decide what remuneration you\\nwould yourself like to receive. One class of high school girls, after a\\ncourse of six laundry lessons, decided that a dollar a dozen was fair pay\\nfor ordinary work! This is an interesting question for class and home\\ndiscussion.\\nDry cleaning.—This is accomplished by gasoline, naphtha, or benzine, and\\nshould not be attempted by the city dweller. In the country or suburbs, it\\nshould be done out of doors, far from any source of fire. Use a basin or\\ntub, and immerse the article in the liquid, using as much as if water,\\nlifting gently up and down. Rinse in a second portion. A suction washer\\nmay be used with large garments. Do not rub the fabric in the liquid.\\nLift, drain, and hang to dry.

       " 'Digestion of the foodstuffs\\nHaving seen what each of the foodstuffs does in nourishing the body, we\\nmay now see how they are prepared for the use of the body in the digestive\\ntract.\\nDigestion of carbohydrate.—The simplest carbohydrate is a sugar which\\ncannot be broken up into other sugars. Such a simple sugar is called a\\nmonosaccharid. There are two common in foods, glucose and fructose; a\\nthird, galactose, is derived from more complex sugars. Two simple sugars\\nunited chemically make a double sugar or disaccharid; thus cane sugar or\\nsucrose will yield glucose and fructose, while milk sugar or lactose will\\nyield glucose and galactose, and maltose will yield two portions of\\nglucose. These three disaccharids are the only common ones. Starches,\\ndextrins, and cellulose or vegetable fiber are made of many simple\\nglucose385\\ngroups, and are hence called polysaccharids. All carbohydrates to be used\\nby the body must be reduced to simple sugars. Glucose needs no digestion\\ntherefore, but the double sugars must be split by enzymes into two simple\\nsugars in the intestinal juice, one for each kind, namely, sucrase\\n(sucrose-splitting), maltase (maltose-splitting) and lactase\\n(lactose-splitting). The digestion of starches and dextrins begins in the\\nmouth, where amylase (starch-splitting) changes starch first to dextrin\\nand finally to maltose, and maltase may change a little of the maltose so\\nformed into glucose. In the stomach there are no enzymes acting on\\ncarbohydrates, but the digestion may continue under the influence of\\nswallowed saliva for a time. In the pancreatic juice there is another\\namylase, which completes the splitting of starch to maltose, and then the\\nintestinal maltase can reduce this to glucose, which will be absorbed.\\nCellulose cannot be digested and simply serves to add bulk to the diet.\\nDigestion of fat.—A fat is made up of two parts, one a fatty acid, the\\nother glycerol. Fat cannot be absorbed by the body until it is split into\\nthese two parts. A fat splitting enzyme is called a lipase. There is none\\nin the mouth; one in the stomach works only on fat in the state of\\nemulsion; the most powerful is found in the pancreatic juice. Since fat\\ncannot be digested in the mouth nor to any great extent in the stomach, it\\nis bad to have food coated with it, for the protein and carbohydrates will\\nhave to wait till the fat is digested away, before they can be digested;\\nthat is, till the intestine is reached. This is one reason why pastries\\nand fried foods are hard to digest.\\nDigestion of protein.—There are no enzymes in the mouth acting on\\nprotein. In the stomach, the hydrochloric acid helps to make it soften and\\nswell, and then pepsin begins its digestion. Protein, like fat and\\ncarbohydrate, can be subdivided into smaller and smaller portions, finally\\nbeing reduced to a form which the body can absorb, namely, amino acids, of\\nwhich there may be 17 or 18 kinds from a single protein.\\nThe digestion in the stomach produces chiefly large fragments of the\\noriginal protein, called proteoses. In the pancreatic juice is a powerful\\nenzyme called trypsin, which digests proteins, first to fragments, next\\nsmaller than proteoses, called peptones, and finally breaks these peptones\\ninto amino acids. In the intestinal juice\\nis386\\nanother enzyme called\\nerepsin, which also forms amino acids from proteoses and peptones, thus\\nfinishing any digestion of protein left incomplete by the trypsin.\\nFate of the absorbed foodstuffs\\nCarbohydrates, absorbed as glucose or other monosaccharids, are carried by\\nthe portal blood to the liver, and thence passed into the blood, to be\\nburned in the muscles, if needed for fuel, or stored temporarily in the\\nliver and muscles as glycogen (a polysaccharid yielding glucose) for\\nfuture conversion to sugar when required as fuel.\\nFats, passing through the intestinal wall as fatty acids and glycerol,\\nenter the lymph largely as fat again, and finally pass to the blood to be\\nburned in the muscles for fuel, or to be stored as fat until needed.\\nProteins pass into the blood as amino acids. Those needed for building\\nmaterial are taken up by the cells (especially cells of the muscles) and\\nthose not required for this purpose are freed from their nitrogen (in the\\nliver or muscles) and then burned for fuel.\\nFor a fuller discussion of the fate of the absorbed foodstuffs see Chapter\\nIV of Sherman’s “Chemistry of Food and Nutrition.”',\n",

List price, $1.25\\n“In preparing this book,” say the authors in the Preface, “we\\nhave tried to select only those topics which are of vital\\ninterest to young people, whether or not they intend to continue\\nthe study of physics in a college course.\\n“In particular, we believe that the chief value of the\\ninformational side of such a course lies in its applications to\\nthe machinery of daily life. Everybody needs to know something\\nabout the working of electrical machinery, optical instruments,\\nships, automobiles, and all those labor-saving devices, such as\\nvacuum cleaners, fireless cookers, pressure cookers, and\\nelectric irons, which are found in many American homes. We have,\\ntherefore, drawn as much of our illustrative material as\\npossible from the common devices in modern life. We see no\\nreason why this should detract in the least from the educational\\nvalue of the study of physics, for one can learn to think\\nstraight just as well by thinking about an electrical generator,\\nas by thinking about a Geissler tube....\\n“To understand any machine clearly, the student must have\\nclearly in mind the fundamental principles involved. Therefore,\\nalthough we have tried to begin each new topic, however short,\\nwith some concrete illustration familiar to young people, we\\nhave proceeded, as rapidly as seemed wise, to a deduction of the\\ngeneral principle. Then, to show how to make use of this\\nprinciple, we have discussed other practical applications. We\\nhave tried to emphasize still further the value of principles,\\nthat is, generalizations, in science, by summarizing at the end\\nof each chapter the principles discussed in that chapter. In\\nthese summaries we have aimed to make the phrasing brief and\\nvivid so that it may be easily remembered and easily used.”\\nThe new and noteworthy features of the book are the admirable selection of\\nfamiliar material used to develop and apply the principles of physical\\nscience, the exceptionally clear and forceful exposition, showing the hand\\nof the master teacher, the practical, interesting, thought-provoking\\nproblems, and the superior illustrations.\\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\\n64-66 Fifth Avenue\\nChicago       New York City     Dallas\\nBoston           Atlanta        San Francisco\\nBotany for Secondary Schools\\nBy L.

We are interested in the evident things of\\nnatural history, and the greater our interest in such things, the wider is\\nour horizon and the deeper our hold on life.\\nThe secondary school could not teach botanical science if it would; lack\\nof time and the immaturity of the pupils forbid it. But it can encourage a\\nlove of nature and an interest in plant study; indeed, it can originate\\nthese, and it does. Professor Bailey’s Botany has been known to do it.\\nIn the revision of this book that has just been made, the effective\\nsimplicity of the nature teacher and the genuine sympathy of the nature\\nlover are as successfully blended as they were in the former book.\\nBailey’s Botany for Secondary Schools recognizes four or five general\\nlife principles: that no two natural things are alike; that each\\nindividual has to make and maintain its place through struggle with its\\nfellows; that “as the twig is bent the tree inclines”; that “like produces\\nlike,” and so on. From these simple laws and others like them Professor\\nBailey proceeds to unfold a wonderful story of plant individuals that have\\nimproved upon their race characteristics, of plant communities that have\\nadopted manners from their neighbors, of features and characteristics that\\nhave been lost by plants because of changed conditions of life or\\nsurroundings. The story vibrates with interest.\\nThe book is, moreover, perfectly organized along the logical lines of\\napproach to a scientific subject.
